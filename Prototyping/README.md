# Prototyping
This folder documents the evolution of our website prototyping, as we used feedback and development experience to evaluate and inform our design process.

Using the ideas generated in our paper prototyping phase, we created digital prototypes for our website that we used in surveys to get feedback on design aspects and inform our product development.

The first two iterations of our prototype came in two flavours: one that used a 3D globe element, and one that used a 2D map design.
