## Website Prototype 1 - Feedback

### Feedback on 23/03/2021

Gathering feedback on the following prototype:

### How the session was conducted:

The two users were thrown in the deep end and provided with limited information of the project’s scope and outline. The users did not know what to expect or what the purpose of the website was. The users were guided through the first 3 canvases as they do not offer any animations / interactive abilities yet. After guiding them through the first 3 canvases, they were able to properly interact with the remaining slides (containing the globe and slider). Technical difficulties e.g. the globe accidentally zooming in at times were explained and were to be ignored (as this is merely a prototype and not a fully working system). 

After using the system and playing around with various movements (for the interactive parts), the interviewer explained to them the project brief and outline i.e. Serious Play – developing a single-page web application for raising awareness around literacy rates. 

Please note that the below feedback has been processed – as such, duplicated feedback has been removed. 

### User 1: 
**Interviewer’s Observations**

1. User understood how to operate the globe.	

2. User understood the slider – did not understand what the slider was for.

3. User did not understand the purpose of the book and the letters being rearranged.

**User’s Feedback**

1. Initial thought is that it is far too simple. 

2. Lacking vibrant colours, nothing stands out. 

3. Background is quite plain looking. 

4. What is the point of scrambling and unscrambling letters / words? 

5. What if I don’t know the name of a country – how might I find it? 

### User 2: 
**Interviewer’s Observations**

1. User found the scrambled to unscrambled letters funny – did not deem it effective (but perhaps was playful?)

2. Was clicking everywhere (a bit too much!). Perhaps it was not evident that the globe needs to be dragged around – directional arrows may be helpful. 
  
**User’s Feedback**

1. What kind of information am I looking for here? Unclear what the outcomes should be.

2. Supposed to raise awareness – might do well with a comparison feature.

3. Unclear where certain countries start / end – a more detailed map would be useful. 

### Feedback on 28/03/2021

### How the session was conducted:

The sessions were conducted in a virtual format with two other users based in other countries, and the session methodology was adapted accordingly. A key challenge with the virtual format rested in preserving uninhibited user control and freedom to explore the draft prototype. In order to achieve this, the prototype was exported from its home on Adobe XD, and the Design Review URL shared with the user at the session start. The user then shared their screen to show their experience of interacting with the prototype. This approach was deemed preferable over the observer sharing their screen, and demonstrating the functionality which would undermine user freedom.

The users had not previously seen or interacted with the prototype prior to the session. In contrast to the previous feedback session on 23 March, the sessions were conducted individually (one user at a time). This was done both for practical reasons (easier to host a remote interview with one respondent at a time to allow for interaction), but also to minimise groupthink and user experiences influencing each other. The session with user 1 was recorded to reference back.

Beyond this, the core approach to the feedback session was maintained. The two users were thrown in the deep end, and provided with limited information of the project’s scope and outline. The users did not know what to expect or what the purpose of the website was. The users were guided through the first 3 canvases as they do not offer any animations / interactive abilities yet. After guiding them through the first 3 canvases, they were able to properly interact with the remaining slides (containing the globe and slider). Technical difficulties e.g. the globe accidentally zooming in at times were explained and were to be ignored (as this is merely a prototype and not a fully working system). 
After using the system and playing around with various movements (for the interactive parts), the interviewer explained to them the project brief and outline I.e. Serious Play – developing a single-page web application for raising awareness around literacy rates. 

### User 3:
**Interviewer’s Observations**

1. User understood how to operate the globe.

2. User understood the slider – did not understand what the slider was for.

3. User was confused initially about not being able to read the text in the book (thought it was merely a placeholder for text to be filled in), but then gathered that it was representing the experience of not being able to read.

4. User found it unclear how the data would be represented (where are the data points?)

**User's feedback**

1. If a central objective is to raise awareness of gaps in literacy rates, focus should be shifted to countries that have lower literacy rates. Current focus may be too much on countries that can read if these shine more brightly from user perspective.

2. Blank, blue background behind the globe could be given more depth. (elaborated in Areas to Improve below)

3. Suggested clarifying the purpose of scrambled text upfront, though potential value in momentary confusion for the user was discussed (as this is the feeling of empathy that we may want to evoke). Observer explained that the scrambled letters would transition to an unscrambled homepage quickly, and the user found that might actually work on its own as well.

4. Highlighted idea of inclusion of sound as potentially interesting

### User 4:
**Interviewer’s Observations**

1. User understood how to operate the globe.

2. User understood the slider – however thought it was intended to control the rotation of the globe.

3. Also found it unclear how the data would be represented on the globe.

**User's feedback**

1. Liked the book design with the faded pages, Lord of the Rings feeling

2. Suggested adding numbers to the slider will help it be understandable as a timeline

3. In general more vibrant colours would help to attract the eye and engage the user

4. Expected the globe to be a 3D sphere as opposed to a 2D surface that you click and drag

5. Was intrigued by the scrambled words and felt it made the user want to know more

### Potential Areas to Improve:
1.	Introduce arrows to guide the user e.g. rotation arrows showing that the globe can spin. 

    - Even a brief tutorial to how to use the website – would be effective if our target audience is children. 

2.	Use gradients and more interesting background colours – need things to be vibrant and pop out. 

    - Black and gold / yellow seem to be common themes and strong contrasting colours. Black and red is another shout. 

3.	Have more information at the start explaining the scrambled words e.g., a short intro sentence asking: “What if you were unable to read?”.

4.	Shift the focus to raising awareness for areas with lower literacy rates - eg. put countries with lower literacy rates in red

5.	Provide more depth to the globe background

    - Include stars and moon, alien spaceship moving past – raises question of how we judge ourselves as a society from an outside perspective? Also, more fun and playful.
    - Other animations could be welcome, the book can start on the cover (showing a title) and then open up.
    - Option to include a background environment to the book, rather than floating in space, eg. A study environment, desk with pens, fireplace

6.	Addition of sound, including spaceship sound, book opening and pages turning

7.	Addition of the data points to the globe in the website prototype to show how these would be represented
