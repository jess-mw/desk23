Gathering feedback on second website paper prototype shown below:

For the second round of feedback sessions, we have taken a similar approach to throwing the users in the deep end once again. However, due to the limitations Adobe XD poses, at times we had to intervene and advise them on what button(s) to click to achieve the response they are seeking for. 

### How the session was conducted:

The two users previously participated in the first feedback session. As such, they understand the brief and the problems we are aiming to tackle. We took down qualitative notes on the users’ actions, after which we asked them for feedback on their experience of the website. The users were then asked to complete a simple questionnaire to help provide us with some quantitative data regarding the website as well. 

This focus group consists of two users. In the previous feedback session, the notes were separately taken. This time, we have consolidated the results into one as there were a lot of similarities between both. 
Please note that the below feedback has been processed – as such, duplicated feedback has been removed.

### Users 1 and 2:

**Interviewer’s Observations**

1. Since the users had already tested the website in the previous feedback session, they had a good understanding of what to expect / how to operate the interface. 
2. One of them tried moving the moon (potential area to improve).
3. Users preferred dragging the globe rather than using the arrows. 
4. User expected the globe to zoom into a country upon being clicked. 

**User Feedback**

1. Consider allowing the user to click to change from pages e.g. someone could miss the opening sentence ‘What if you were unable to read?’.
2. Introductory line does provide a lot more information – nice approach!
3. Maybe indicate the literacy rates disparities at the start if that is your goal.
4. Instructions/hints are clear and used well.
5. Might be more effective if after each hint, the user is able to test it out. For example, when it says “Click the arrows to explore”, the user should be able to click the either of the arrows and the globe should spin. Likewise with other hints. 
6. Dragging the globe is cool – like before – but will it be able to move in all directions or just left and right? (Was explained to be a limitation of Adobe XD and that the globe hopefully will be able to move in all directions).
7. Really like the overall design – colours are much more vibrant and the arrows make it seem a lot more fun (which they understand to be a part of the brief).
8. Would be better if the slider showed which year it currently was on rather than just the first and final year. 
9. What do all the lights represent on the globe? How do I know which country is which e.g. if I am unsure of where a certain country is?

### Feedback on 11/04/2021

### How the session was conducted:

The user previously participated in the first feedback session. As such, the user understood the brief and the problems we are aiming to tackle. The session was conducted online using Zoom. A link to the updated prototype was shared with the user at the beginning of the session. The user shared their screen and interacted with the prototype, while the observer took qualitative notes on the user’s actions, after which we asked them for feedback on their experience of the website. 

### User 3:
**Interviewer’s Observations**

1. User could interact with the globe without guidance
2. Explanation of the transitions between the website features was needed, specifically how the letters would unscramble
3. User could use the slider and understood that it represented the passage of time

**User's feedback**

1. Range of motion of the globe – incorporation of up/down movement rather than limiting to left/right may seem more globe-like, tangible and interactive
2. Could link movement to the position of the sun – keeping the light only on one side of the globe, and seeing it disappear into darkness on horizon as the user rotates the globe.
3. Image looks dead – bring twinkles into the stars, make the lights in the arrows flash. Features can move or light up as the user hovers over them to get a sense of the page reacting to user movements.
4. With the perspective of looking at the globe from afar, gives a sense that our differences are diminished – effective way to talk about literacy rates as a global issue.
5. As we built out the space theme (stars and landing page), book and space theme difficult to reconcile. Book feels out of place – what is a book doing in space? Find a way to link them for more cohesive design. The book title page gives a strong impression of the website being an educational tool from the outset.
6. Landing page evokes Star Wars opening credits

### Feedback on 15/04/2021

### How the session was conducted:
This session was conducted in person, but the audio was recorded with the user’s consent for later reference. The user had not participated in the previous sessions. They were briefed and the project scope was explained to them. They were shown the prototype and left to interact with it whilst the interviewer observed, answering any questions the user had. After interacting with it, we spoke about any feedback they had.

### User 4:
**Interviewer’s Observations**

1. User needed little guidance to interact with the globe, timeline, and arrows.

2. Moved the timeline around but didn’t really like not being able to fully move it from one end to the other – wanted to keep it scrolling more

**User's feedback**

1. Globe as it currently stands is a little difficult to interact with, the arrows should be changed to something simpler

2. The timeline should show which year it is currently in, rather than jumping from one end to the other

3. Good for (school) years 7-8, older students might look for a few minutes and then get bored

4. Should make the content engaging and easy to read – try and avoid information overload 

5. The more countries we have information about the better – annoying when it is Western-centric

7. The moon is a nice touch

### Potential Areas to Improve:
1. The moon or the sun could be our slider! If we can figure out a way to create a curved slider over the top of the globe that is...
2. Perhaps the arrows could be made more simple, and should only exist as hints rather than usable items? 
3. Try to bring the website to life – incorporate small, interactive movements as this would make it more engaging
4. Make clearer the connection between the book and the globe floating in space. Discuss as a group the theme that we really want to highlight.
5. Transitions between website features could be clarified- how does the landing page switch to the book? How do the letters unscramble? How do we go from viewing the book to the globe?
6. Perhaps have a key to explain what the different colours mean (if we are displaying the countries in different colours)
7. Could make it clearer what the timeline is for/does
