## Paper Prototypes Review
After having basic verbal evaluations of our idea, most of the team members created a paper prototype with their own visualisation
of what the website should look like. We then went through each idea and documented their pros and cons to select which elements 
from each design we really liked.

## Paper prototype 1: Jessica - Globe
| Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- |
| Simple, playful and effective | Similar models exist (albeit for different things) - not much innovation |
| Allows high level of interaction | Does it show why understanding literacy rates is important? |
| Use of colour / light intensity is a good visual method – caters to people who may be unable to read properly | Is it clear who the audience is? Who would it be interesting to? |
| Informative and easy to understand the info being displayed | Not clear how the data would be displayed |
| Multiple ways to interact with the model – visual, sound, touch | Can you compare data? What is the data supposed to help us with? |
| Good balance between text, images and sound – not purely data focused – ideal for younger people | Not transferrable to other issues (if we choose to expand scope) |
