## Paper Prototypes Review
After having basic verbal evaluations of our idea, most of the team members created a paper prototype with their own visualisation
of what the website should look like. We then went through each idea and documented their pros and cons to select which elements 
from each design we really liked.

### Paper prototype 1: Jessica - Globe
| Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- |
| Simple, playful and effective | Similar models exist (albeit for different things) - not much innovation |
| Allows high level of interaction | Does it show why understanding literacy rates is important? |
| Use of colour / light intensity is a good visual method – caters to people who may be unable to read properly | Is it clear who the audience is? Who would it be interesting to? |
| Informative and easy to understand the info being displayed | Not clear how the data would be displayed |
| Multiple ways to interact with the model – visual, sound, touch | Can you compare data? What is the data supposed to help us with? |
| Good balance between text, images and sound – not purely data focused – ideal for younger people | Not transferrable to other issues (if we choose to expand scope) |

### Paper prototype 2: Emily - Unscrambled Homepage
| Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- |
| A good way to add a playful element into a serious topic | Might be difficult to integrate the playful elements with the more serious ones |
| Can be used to as a loading screen effect when added to a data heavy topic | Possible complex API for scrambling individual characters |
| Unscrambling of words playful and a good idea that can be carried through the website – tackles the serious element and the play well | Animations required might be difficult to do  |
| A more direct way of showing what might be like if unable to read | |
| Not too complex for target audience, should help to engage them | |

### Paper prototype 3: Emily - Mini Survey
| Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- |
| Simple and fun! Allows users to learn about themselves without going to a database website and using ctrl + f to search up their own countries | Might be too simple? At least with regards to front-end and UI/UX |
| Blends with other ideas well – can be added to other conceptions | People might be reticent to give out location/personal data |
| Leading on from the idea that it might be too simple, this could be effective if our target audience and younger people | People might want to see all data (not just personalised data) |
| | Less directly linked to the topic of literacy rates than some of the other options being explored |
