# Data Model

This document shows the design and evolution of our data model.

*	Suggesting MongoDB for storage
*	Front end consumes data from own API and database, but can populate your own database with other databases using functions within node
*	Think about way that data is transferred between front and back

What are the entities in the system?
*	Whole globe
*	Each country
*	Welcome page


Model
*	Look up information stored on welcome page
*	Take in information about where the user’s mouse is
*	Look up overview statistics for a county
*	Take in information about what the user does next – whether they click on a country or move mouse to hover over another country
*	Look up detailed statistics for a country
*	Take in information about whether the user exists these details
*	Reading data of statistics for each country, and then storing that somewhere it can be accessed to adjust the display of countries (i.e. how dark or bright they are)
