# Literacy Rates Around the World (working title)

Over the past 65 years, literacy rates have increased globally by 4% every five years. Today, only 14% of the global population remain illiterate. However, in many countries they remain unsettlingly low, with the poorest countries having large segments of their population illiterate. This exemplifies huge global inequalities that exist, notably between sub-Saharan Africa and the West.
Despite many countries having high levels of basic literacy skills, there remain suprisingly high rates of very poor literacy skills. In England, for example, 1 in 6 adults have poor literacy skills. This means that they can understand short and straightforward texts on familiar subjects, but struggle with unfamiliar sources or topics. This is also known as being functionally illiterate, and excludes people from many areas of the job market thus further contributing to inequality.

Our project aims to build awareness about this issue, in a fun and informative way to encourage learning and engagement.

## Our idea

We envision an interactive globe that users can nagivate and move around with ease. Upon entering the website, the user is greeted with a book with scrambled letters on that merge into a description of the site. Users can then click through to the globe. Countries are lit up in brightness that accords with their levels of literacy rates. By hovering their mouse over a country, users can view basic statistics about that country. By clicking on the country, we zoom into a more detailed map and list further, more detailed, information related to that country, for example links to charities and ways to help. There may possibly be a time dimension, where we can view how literacy rates have evolved over time.

## Our Users

Our site is targeted at older children and teenagers, to encourage awareness about the issue. By including playful elements, we aim to get our users engaging with the issue. This will hopefully foster interest in literacy rates, and help our users understand why it is an important topic.

## Stakeholders

Our most important primary stakeholders are our users, and also those of whom the data is about. We do not have any access to personal details of our stakeholders but should consider what effects the website might have. See "Stakeholder Anaylsis" document in DesignElements/Ideation for more information.

## UX Design
The ideation process took place collaboratively over several team meetings. The first session involved brainstorming and divergent thinking, aided by the mapping technique of putting serious topics and playful implementations next to each other to let ideas come out in unexpected ways (see Ideation > ideaMatrix document). The team then narrowed down ideas from this list, through allocating points to preferred topics. Once four core ideas had been identified, they were assessed for their strengths/limitations and feasibility. This was achieved through group writing on a shared document, which proved very effective in allowing team members to build on each other’s ideas and let creativity flow. At the conclusion of this process, the team had a clearer idea of the concept and was able to agree to move ahead with an interactive representation of global literacy rates. To elaborate on the idea, from this starting point, the team members went away individually to create paper (or digital) prototypes. We then convened to present these to each other and highlight the features that we imagined as part of the project. The design was then consolidated based on common elements, aided by additional group writing, into a singular paper prototype. We further were able to pull out interesting elements from each team member’s design through a "mash up" session dedicated to inventing unique combinations of ideas.
