# Literacy Rates Around the World (working title)

Over the past 65 years, literacy rates have increased globally by 4% every five years. Today, only 14% of the global population remain illiterate. However, in many countries they remain unsettlingly low, with the poorest countries having large segments of their population illiterate. This exemplifies huge global inequalities that exist, notably between sub-Saharan Africa and the West.
Despite many countries having high levels of basic literacy skills, there remain suprisingly high rates of very poor literacy skills. In England, for example, 1 in 6 adults have poor literacy skills. This means that they can understand short and straightforward texts on familiar subjects, but struggle with unfamiliar sources or topics. This is also known as being functionally illiterate, and excludes people from many areas of the job market thus further contributing to inequality.

Our project aims to build awareness about this issue, in a fun and informative way to encourage learning and engagement.

## Our idea

We envision an interactive globe that users can nagivate and move around with ease. Upon entering the website, the user is greeted with a book with scrambled letters on that merge into a description of the site. Users can then click through to the globe. Countries are lit up in brightness that accords with their levels of literacy rates. By hovering their mouse over a country, users can view basic statistics about that country. By clicking on the country, we zoom into a more detailed map and list further, more detailed, information related to that country, for example links to charities and ways to help. There may possibly be a time dimension, where we can view how literacy rates have evolved over time.

## Our Users

Our site is targeted at older children and teenagers, to encourage awareness about the issue. By including playful elements, we aim to get our users engaging with the issue. This will hopefully foster interest in literacy rates, and help our users understand why it is an important topic.

## Stakeholders

Our most important primary stakeholders are our users, and also those of whom the data is about. We do not have any access to personal details of our stakeholders but should consider what effects the website might have. See "Stakeholder Anaylsis" document in DesignElements/Ideation for more information.

## UX Design
The ideation process took place collaboratively over several team meetings. The first session involved brainstorming and divergent thinking, aided by the mapping technique of putting serious topics and playful implementations next to each other to let ideas come out in unexpected ways (see Ideation > ideaMatrix document). The team then narrowed down ideas from this list, through allocating points to preferred topics. Once four core ideas had been identified, they were assessed for their strengths/limitations and feasibility. This was achieved through group writing on a shared document, which proved very effective in allowing team members to build on each other’s ideas and let creativity flow. At the conclusion of this process, the team had a clearer idea of the concept and was able to agree to move ahead with an interactive representation of global literacy rates. To elaborate on the idea, from this starting point, the team members went away individually to create paper (or digital) prototypes. We then convened to present these to each other and highlight the features that we imagined as part of the project. The design was then consolidated based on common elements, aided by additional group writing, into a singular paper prototype using Canva. We further were able to pull out interesting elements from each team member’s design through a "mash up" session dedicated to inventing unique combinations of ideas. 

The next step was to develop a survey to cast the net wider to collect insights, validate fundamental assumptions underpinning the project, and inform the design. The survey was created using SurveyMonkey and shared with the team’s networks. The form included 10 multiple choice or free form questions geared towards understanding user preferences for data representation (based on the paper prototype) to augment the user experience, and gathering information on pre-existing knowledge about global literacy rates. The team analysed the 26 responses received and sought to take into account the feedback as the paper prototype was transformed into a Wireframe using Adobe XD. The survey results confirmed that an interactive globe would be a more interesting way to represent data, versus a tabular format or a static map. When selecting from a list where multiple options were permitted, 21 respondents (84 percent) said an interactive visualization would enhance the user experience, and 16 (64 percent) said it would be a fun and playful approach. Importantly, 18 (72 percent) said that it offers an improved understanding of what the data represents, a key assumption behind the educational aspect of the website.

**Stakeholder Analysis**

In parallel, the team met to identify the stakeholders who would be involved in or otherwise impacted by the project. The stakeholder analysis was done in order to maximise the possible contribution of the project and anticipate the various interactions with other parties to be cognizant of the impacts, including ethical considerations. After initial brainstorming, mapping primary and secondary stakeholders and their possible interests and concerns, this chart was produced using Miro (see below) to demonstrate how stakeholders would be managed over the course of the project.

Stakeholders with high influence and high interest in the project include the target user (students/adolescents), the team itself (given a vested interest in the website’s success), and the University of Bristol as the locus of the project (including any potential reputational risks), and were deemed to require close engagement. In particular, given the educational nature of the website, the team agreed it would key to make sure that the website would be an inclusive and safe space for students of all abilities and backgrounds to navigate.

Next, the team considered others in the immediate circle of the student, including family and friends, and, critically, teachers who would need to be kept informed – in particular given their responsibility to safeguard their students and their role in potentially directing students to the website as an educational tool. Research participants, including users interacting with the surveys and making up the focus group, were also considered to fall in this category. The team considered it would be critical to seek out a diverse group of participants to ensure balanced responses; to make sure the survey would be designed not to be overly invasive; and, fundamentally, to protect the data collected. 

The awareness raising component of the website, from the general nature of the topic being treated, to any more specific links or resources provided on the page, could potentially implicate secondary stakeholders, including NGOs and charities. In directing traffic towards their causes, it would be important to scrutinise any organisations before listing them on the website to make sure users are directed to valid charities and to avoid inadvertently propagating scams. 

Other secondary stakeholders could include policymakers and international development partners looking for effective communication tools about literacy rates. 

It was noted that, though the website itself does not collect data from users, we would need to consider where we source our data from to ensure accuracy and consider attribution and any related licensing issues. In this respect, the data owners would need to be kept satisfied, and data properly referenced. Given that they could decide at any moment to restrict access to their data, the data owners were considered to have high power.
