# Left Unread

Over the past 65 years, literacy rates have increased globally by 4% every five years. Today, only 14% of the global population remain illiterate. However, in many countries they remain unsettlingly low, with the poorest countries having large segments of their population illiterate. This exemplifies huge global inequalities that exist, notably between sub-Saharan Africa and the West.
Despite many countries having high levels of basic literacy skills, there remain suprisingly high rates of very poor literacy skills. In England, for example, 1 in 6 adults have poor literacy skills. This means that they can understand short and straightforward texts on familiar subjects, but struggle with unfamiliar sources or topics. This is also known as being functionally illiterate, and excludes people from many areas of the job market thus further contributing to inequality.

Our project aims to build awareness about this issue, in a fun and informative way to encourage learning and engagement.

## Our Idea

We envision an interactive globe that users can nagivate and move around with ease. Upon entering the website, the user is greeted with a book with scrambled letters on that merge into a description of the site. Users can then click through to the globe. Countries are lit up in brightness that accords with their levels of literacy rates. By hovering their mouse over a country, users can view basic statistics about that country. By clicking on the country, we zoom into a more detailed map and list further, more detailed, information related to that country, for example links to charities and ways to help. There may possibly be a time dimension, where we can view how literacy rates have evolved over time.

## Our Users

Our site is targeted at older children and teenagers, to encourage awareness about the issue. By including playful elements, we aim to get our users engaging with the issue. This will hopefully foster interest in literacy rates, and help our users understand why it is an important topic.

## Stakeholders

Our most important primary stakeholders are our users, and also those of whom the data is about. We do not have any access to personal details of our stakeholders but should consider what effects the website might have. See "Stakeholder Anaylsis" document in DesignElements/Ideation for more information.

## Introduction [10 marks] 

### Abstract. Motivation for the project, framing of the problem and a high-level overview of the system. 

Literacy’s importance cannot be understated. From an individual perspective, low literacy rates can be correlated with worsened job outcomes and lower-earning potentials, and from a national outlook, lower levels of literacy can mar a nation’s economic competitiveness, as well as being linked to drastically lower economic performance metrics such as Gross National Product and Human Development Index. 
The motivation for this project is the goal of being able to directly convey to our target user group the state of global literacy rates as well as trace its ensuing rise over time through the medium of the web in a way that is more engaging than the typical tabulated data presented by some websites.
To achieve this, we have created a Single Page Application (SPA) designed to show the contrasting literacy levels across the world with the important distinction of being “playful” in its implementation. This gamified approach served as a requirement of the brief and in accordance with this objective, the project’s defining feature is a 3D Globe built using the MEAN stack: MongoDB is used to store literacy rates data whilst Express is utilized to serve that data through an API by listening to requests from the NodeJS runtime. The front-end is implemented using Angular.
