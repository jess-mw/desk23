# Ethical Framework

When designing and building an artefact, it is important to apply an ethical framework to guide the development of technology and keep the wider context in which you are working in mind. This means going beyond being compliant, to designing with ethical purpose and embedding it in the project throughout development (and beyond).  Before settling on an idea for this project, as a team we had a discussion of ethics in order to decide upon a framework which we would use to guide our design process. We felt that the brief of this project – creating a playful product that tackled a serious problem – in combination with the importance of technology in everyday life meant that paying attention to ethics was particularly important.  

## Creating a framework

Using normative ethics (how to decide whether something is good), we considered different current codes of conduct in industry to create our own standard by which to work from. We evaluated relevant principles from consequentialist (specifically utilitarianist: a phenomena is good if it provides the most amount of good for the greatest number) and deontic (a phenomena is good if it follows a set of rules - rules in this case being laws, industry regulations, and relevant codes of conduct) perspectives. Throughout this process, we tried to consider what the unintended consequences might be. 

We first looked at the [BCS code of practice](https://www.bcs.org/membership/become-a-member/bcs-code-of-conduct/). The benefits of this code is that it is specifically relevant to the domain of computer science, and is widely used in industry. It is likely that, if we went on to work as computer scientists, we would be expected to sign up to a code of practice such as this one thus it seemed beneficial to familiarise ourselves with it. Principles that we took from BCS included: 

1. You make IT for everyone – keep the public interest in mind and promote equal access. Especially as our project concerns global data, keeping it accessible to all was something particularly important to us. 

2. Respect the organisation or individual you work for – this organisation for us is the University of Bristol, whom we maintained our responsibility towards in our consciousness throughout the project.  

Principles we chose not to include in our framework: 

1. Show what you know, learn what you don’t - as every member of our team has come to this course from a non-technical background, we were all learning the skills needed to develop this website almost from scratch. We thus embraced the idea of developing our professional knowledge, and being honest about our abilities, however in some areas it was a necessity to undertake work that in a working environment would be beyond our “professional competence” in order to learn the required skills. 

2. Keep IT real. Keep IT professional. Pass IT on – as we are not actual BCS members at this stage, this principle was less applicable to us. However, respect for our team members and other students was held of great importance throughout the process. 

We then looked at the [UNICEF principles for child-centred innovation](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_ethics_of_innovation), which was recommended in the course material. We chose this code because it is relevant to our target audience – older children. Because this is a vulnerable group, it is important to consider ethical frameworks that are relevant to this group and specific issues that might arise. In addition, we liked the emphasis on keeping the wider world in the forefront of the development process. 

Principles we chose to include in our framework: 

1. Design with the user – it is important to keep the user at the centre of our minds, as this is who the product is for. As our users are a vulnerable group, it was not possible to design directly with them, however ways that we mitigated this was by asking survey respondents and focus group members to “place yourselves in the shoes of your younger selves”. 

2. Understand the existing ecosystem - appreciate the context within which we are developing the application: not only what existing technology there is, but also the context of relevant charities and other educational sources for data display. We tackled this by conducting contextual research at the start of our design process. 

3. Design for scale - ensuring that our application could be scalable to other contexts and markets. Although this we did not achieve this in this evolution of the product, future improvements would include having the website in different languages and audio description for the visually impaired. As the artefact does not store any data from the user, our datasets would not grow exponentially with expansion of scale. 

4. Be data driven - the use of data is one of the key areas in which the tech industry has historically hugely misjudged. The impact of unethical use of data has led to huge ramifications in society. Thus, we saw this as a very important principle to guide the development of our product, protect our stakeholders, and foster making a beneficial contribution. In addition, using data to guide decisions encourages better decision making – [it has been found](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/data-driven-decision-making) that highly data-driven organizations are three times more likely to report significant improvements in decision making.  

5. Use open standards/data/source/innovation - the use of open standards is key to encouraging innovation and improving technology. Our project was kept as a public repository on GitHub, and we took advantage of open data sources for our database, including [literacy rates](https://ourworldindata.org/literacy#:~:text=While%20only%2012%25%20of%20the,1960%20to%2086%25%20in%202015) and [coordinates](https://github.com/DavidGrice/THREEJS-Tutorial-Globe/blob/master/START/public/DATA/Final_data.json) . We created our own dataset that combined the two in a way that suited our purposes, and made this publicly available on our GitHub, after ensuring that there was no sensitive information in it. 

6. Reuse and improve - we tried to design our product with the aim that the code we were writing could be adapted, reused, and improved in future developments of the site. 

7. Do no harm - both in the process of design and development, as well as in the deployment and future use of our work. 

8. Be collaborative – to fulfil this we made sure to include feedback from others external to the team. This included talking to other students in our cohort, having a focus group that we met with regularly to discuss design decisions, and getting ethical feedback from people outside of the realm of computer science. 

Principles we chose not to include in our framework: 

1. Build for sustainability - this is a principle that we take as being extremely important, however at this stage of our product and technical ability, it is not something that we felt we would be able to fully achieve. We also took this as being able to integrate under the principle “build for scale”, as we see a part of building for scale being ensuring that as the product grows, it is sustainable. Future work on our product would include research into making our processes more efficient and green-friendly. 

There were many other codes we briefly looked at, including [ACS code of ethics](https://www.acs.org.au/content/dam/acs/acs-documents/Code-of-Ethics.pdf), [Google’s AI principles](https://ai.google/principles) and the [OECD principles for AI](https://www.oecd.org/going-digital/ai/principles/). Although some of these are designed for AI, they has also wider implications for other forms of technology. However, we decided that central themes bridging these codes were covered in the principles we had chosen. 

After creating the framework, we spoke to an individual with a formal ethical education background to gain an outsiders perspective. This is extremely useful in the framing of ethical discussions to highlight issues that insiders may be blind to, thus avoiding the effect of “tunnel vision”. 

## The Framework

## Using the framework 

When working through the design process and sprints, we followed the [DIODE](https://www.zyen.com/media/documents/ethical-assessment.pdf) procedure for ethical analysis. In brief, this procedure works by: 

1. Define questions – ensure that we have defined the project in which the ethical questions are framed. 

2. Issues analysis – ensure all relevant stakeholders are considered and relevant risks and rewards are considered from both consequentialist and deontological perspectives. 

3. Options evaluation – ensures relevant choices are made. 

4. Decision determination – ensure we could clearly state ethical decisions made and reasoning behind them. 

5. Explanations dissemination – ensures that decisions are communicated appropriately. 

Using our ethical framework, we used this procedure to analyse decisions and choose which form of action to take accordingly. 

To ensure our ethics were properly communicated, we documented our obligations and any risks and safeguards we took to protect our users. In addition, we gave users we interacted with a contact address they could reach out to if they felt us to be in breach of these obligations, and used an ethics form before each session.
