Coronavirus meant that the teamâ€™s interaction was conducted online - standups were held online, and group members relied heavily on platforms such as Teams for day-to-day communication. On the one hand, technical issues at times made this more complicated, including poor speaker quality or buffering/frozen participants in calls obfuscating certain contributions, but this also brought some unexpected perks such as being able to share resources with each other live, as we were on a call, and having a common reference point, a de facto transcript of the conversation that could be referred back to recall a point that was raised, or a decision that had been reached. However, team building and morale were made more challenging due to the restrictions from COVID-19 since it was not possible to work together in person.

COVID-19 conditions also complicated user testing, making identifying and accessing focus group participants more difficult by restricting the available formats in which these could take place and limiting in-person interviews to household bubbles. User testing was particularly tricky for feedback sessions that relied heavily on the interviewer observing the user's interaction with a prototype. Observational notes made up an important part of the qualitative data collected to inform the design and improve the user experience, underpinning the thematic analysis and findings, so it was important that these could be gathered in a reliable and rigorous way.

With COVID-19, it became more difficult to allow the user uninhibited access to the prototype in order to freely explore the functionality and design. It also became more challenging for the interviewer to pick up on user reactions and feelings for the interpretation part of the research process. To mitigate these challenges, recordings were used to be able to reference back more complex feedback or to catch things that may have been missed the first time. In addition, semi-structured feedback sessions, guided by a set of questions and a protocol for interaction helped a lot, particularly for the virtual interviews. Technologies like screen sharing and allowing users remote access to the observer's computer helped, though these also opened up new ethics issues that needed to be addressed (see Ethics section). It was also more difficult to build trust with the users and make them feel comfortable, who, even though they were often family members or friends, may have been unused to the new setting.

## d. Discussion of Social and Ethical implications of your work.

Creating a product that was well thought out in terms of social and ethical implications was of great importance to our team. We thus began the project by laying out a carefully discussed ethical framework, please see [our ethical framework documentation](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/4b902717876a0090c4f51f1c1b984127c6931e80/Documentation/6.%20Conclusion/Ethical%20Framework.md) for the details of how we went about creating this and the [final principles](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/main/Documentation/6.%20Conclusion/Ethical%20Framework.md#the-framework) we decided upon.

Looking at the progress of the project retrospectively from the lense of our ethical framework, there are some areas that could be improved. For example, one of our main priorities was to build for everyone. However, due to limitations on time, this is not something that we have achieved to the extent that we were hoping to. The website as it currently stands is not very accessible for people that have disabilities. A future extension of the project could be to improve these features, for instance by including audio descriptions and options to increase font size. Due to limitations with our data set, there are also several countries for which we have no, or very little, data. This contributes to existing biases by enhancing existing imbalances in research. Thus, a future extension would be to target the missing data and fill the gaps. In addition, our website is only available in English, making it inaccessible for users who do not speak the language. We would ideally like to make the website available to as many languages as we can.

Whilst we have tried to design with the user in mind, due to safeguarding concerns, we have conducted no research with our actual target group. This is not deviating from our ethical framework as it is in their interest that this has not happened,  but there are some aspects of their experience that we may have missed because of this. An extension to the project, with proper ethical approval and safeguarding measures in place, could be to conduct a study with this user group to ensure we are targeting their interests. Another extension could be an in depth analysis to ensure that the website is a safe and secure space for our vulnerable user group.

Designing for scale is something we have tried to address through the choice of MongoDB for our database, and rooting the development in docker. However, there are likely adjustments that would need to be made for increased scalability.

One aspect of our framework we feel we addressed well was to be data driven. We ensured that the majority of our design choices were driven by data gathered in feedback sessions with our users. We also used open source data sets, and made the collection we created ourselves to be open source as well. We could still enhance our practices in this area by ensuring that we have a more diverse user group in our feedback sessions, and gathering a larger pool of data to improve the fairness of our results.
