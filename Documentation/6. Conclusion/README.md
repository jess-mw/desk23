Coronavirus meant that the teamâ€™s interaction was conducted online - standups were held online, and group members relied heavily on platforms such as Teams for day-to-day communication. On the one hand, technical issues at times made this more complicated, including poor speaker quality or buffering/frozen participants in calls obfuscating certain contributions, but this also brought some unexpected perks such as being able to share resources with each other live, as we were on a call, and having a common reference point, a de facto transcript of the conversation that could be referred back to recall a point that was raised, or a decision that had been reached. However, team building and morale were made more challenging due to the restrictions from COVID-19 since it was not possible to work together in person.

COVID-19 conditions also complicated user testing, making identifying and accessing focus group participants more difficult by restricting the available formats in which these could take place and limiting in-person interviews to household bubbles. User testing was particularly tricky for feedback sessions that relied heavily on the interviewer observing the user's interaction with a prototype. Observational notes made up an important part of the qualitative data collected to inform the design and improve the user experience, underpinning the thematic analysis and findings, so it was important that these could be gathered in a reliable and rigorous way.

With COVID-19, it became more difficult to allow the user uninhibited access to the prototype in order to freely explore the functionality and design. It also became more challenging for the interviewer to pick up on user reactions and feelings for the interpretation part of the research process. To mitigate these challenges, recordings were used to be able to reference back more complex feedback or to catch things that may have been missed the first time. In addition, semi-structured feedback sessions, guided by a set of questions and a protocol for interaction helped a lot, particularly for the virtual interviews. Technologies like screen sharing and allowing users remote access to the observer's computer helped, though these also opened up new ethics issues that needed to be addressed (see Ethics section). It was also more difficult to build trust with the users and make them feel comfortable, who, even though they were often family members or friends, may have been unused to the new setting.
