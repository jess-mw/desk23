## c. Clear definition of the problem. How does your project relate to the above? We will be marking the ability of your team to identify a worthwhile and important problem and clearly articulate the scope and challenge of the problem.

We have seen that literacy rates often translate into economic opportunity, and is often a prerequisite for tapping into wider networks of communication between people and a foundation on which to build further skills. The ability to read and write has throughout history allowed people to spread ideas and exercise power and influence. On the other side of the coin, literacy allows the consumption of ideas and the ability to engage with debates, and access to knowledge and learning, which ties into human dignity, and opportunities for spiritual enrichment. The problem of low literacy rates and insufficient access to education is very real, yet often understated, where many people underestimate the scale of the issue and falsely assume that this was a problem of the past that has largely been resolved. Often this can be because literacy rates data has been viewed as a whole, a positive global rising trend that may have obscured the remaining problem. The signficance of contrasts in global literacy rates, and the inequalities that they represent, has also not been highlighted in discussion about global inequalities. Access to education is intersectional in nature, where educational and social opportunities are available to differing degrees according to gender, race, economic status, caste, disabilities or special education needs, and identity. 

Against this backdrop, the resources currently available to communicate about global literacy rates is lacking. As described in the section above, surprisingly few map or globe-based data visualisations exist, and much of global literacy rates data is confined to dense databases using technical language maintained by international organisations or NGOs. The existing data visualisations make use of line graphs, scatter plots, bar charts, or 2D maps and rarely have interactive features. These often technical and dense presentations of the data may affect young people the most, and may be exacerbated by reportedly shorter attention spans of digital natives, the current generation exposed to technology from an early age. At the same time, young people will grow up to shape the future and therefore represent a demographic that cannot be overlooked in discussions about literacy. They also have recent experience with schooling and education, from which we may infer a personal link to the data.

The project will seek to fill this gap by providing an alternative data visualisation which responds to the brief of serious play, and seeks to make global literacy rates data interesting and fun, particularly for younger generations. The visualisation is interactive, allowing discovery of the data and hands-on opportunities to click and manipulate the globe, intended to engage the user. A 3D globe format was chosen given the global nature of the issue of illiteracy, making this a natural way to visualise the data and bring out disparities between countries. The project will also clarify trends and patterns in the data, which would otherwise be difficult to detect if it remains in the database. As such, national and regional differences will come to light, and it will be easier to identify areas with low literacy rates without much effort.
