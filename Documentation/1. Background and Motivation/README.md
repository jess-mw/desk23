### Context & scoping the problem
Literacy is something that many take for granted: an aspect of life that is almost as given as breathing. Our society is heavily structured around being literate, and for those who are not literate, life can be extremely hard. Globally, there still remain huge disparities in literacy rates mirroring wider global inequalities that exist today. Whilst in many countries, more than [95%](https://ourworldindata.org/literacy) have basic literacy skills, large inequalities remain most notably in sub-Saharan Africa. Historically, there is also a large gender gap in literacy rates, exacerbating gender inequality and equal access. However, with the increase in literacy rates, it [has been found](https://nces.ed.gov/naal/lit_history.asp) that gender and racial inequalities decrease. Additionally, improving literacy rates [has been shown](https://plan-uk.org/blogs/the-importance-of-education-how-literacy-improves-lives) to lift individuals out of poverty, improve the development of the wider community, and reduce infant mortality rates. [It can also](https://www.costercontent.co.uk/blog/literacy-trust-literacy-problem) improve efficiency and employee satisfaction in business. Our aim with this project is to increase awareness about global literacy rates in a playful manner, to engage our target audience in a way that is novel and enjoyable for them to interact with, thus [increasing the likelihood](http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/112003/chapters/Understanding-Children%27s-Motivation.aspx) that they will retain the information.

### Methodology
To conduct our literature review, we first defined two research questions to guide our search and analysis. These were:

1. What is the current global state of literacy rates?
We developed this question to ensure that we had a good understanding of what the problem, and up to date information about the issue we are trying to address.
2. How can literacy rates be improved?
The purpose of this question is to guide the aims and objectives of our project, so that we can create an artefact that is suitable for its purpose.

### 1. What is the current global state of literacy rates?
[Our World in Data]( https://ourworldindata.org/literacy?_ke=eyJrbF9lbWFpbCI6ICJweGdqZ2htaHdmb0BtaWxsZWRtYWlsLmNvbSIsICJrbF9jb21wYW55X2lkIjogIm5GRWUzUiJ9) have found that overall, the global literacy rate is high, however there remain large disparities between richer and poorer countries. Lower literacy rates in poorer countries mirrors the socio-economic inequality and global crises over food, and [Easton (2014)]( https://inee.org/system/files/resources/UNESCO_Sustaining_Literacy_in_Africa-_Developing_a_Literate_Environment.pdf) argues that with literacy comes opportunities to the disenfranchised to raise income levels and secure access to political, economic, and cultural opportunities. By looking at the problem through the lens of “literate environments” (an environment that cultivates literate skills), Easton found that in Africa, there is a good deal of inertia of institutions that are supposed to be working towards improving literate environments. They found that building sustainable literate environments is an arduous task - a lifetime vocation - and frequently staff are not well enough trained. Although this research was conducted some years ago now, the disparity between sub-Saharan African literacy rates and the rest of the world remains, thus it is likely that the issues Easton talks about are still contributing to the problem.
In the last century, [Our World in Data]( https://ourworldindata.org/literacy?_ke=eyJrbF9lbWFpbCI6ICJweGdqZ2htaHdmb0BtaWxsZWRtYWlsLmNvbSIsICJrbF9jb21wYW55X2lkIjogIm5GRWUzUiJ9) show how countries in Northern Africa and the Middle East have drastically improved literacy rates across just one generation, and Latin America has greatly improved over the last century. [Singer (2015)](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.12987/9780300182415-003/html) argues that altruism should be backed up by evidence and reasoning to find the most effective ways of improving the lives of others. The evidence provided by Our World in Data illustrates the overall global trend towards higher literacy rates, lending evidence to it being a worthwhile cause to get behind, as it is a problem that is solvable and can be effectively tackled given the right resources.
[Richmond, Robinson and Sachs-Israel (2012)]( https://www.right-to-education.org/sites/right-to-education.org/files/resource-attachments/UNESCO_The_Global_Literacy_Challenge_2008_En.pdf) found that globally literacy rates are rising and there is an awareness that it is an issue that needs addressing. However, when the paper was written, almost one in five of the adult population do not have the basic literacy and numeracy skills required to fully participate in society. Interestingly, they also found that in some regions of high population growth, the number of those without literacy is growing. 
In more recent research, [Murray (2021)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09669760.2021.1883816) argues that the current literacy rate is inadequate, and current measures of literacy fail to appreciate a broader understanding of the reality of how literacy encompasses the myriad of ways that humans communicate. Murray shows that low literacy rates cause drastic losses to economies and high costs to governments, as they are correlated with higher crime rates, poor health, and higher welfare costs. This is because, Murray explains, those who cannot read and write are excluded from the opportunities presented to those who can. Murray argues that school attendance is intrinsically linked to literacy rates, and thus with attendance drastically lowering over the course of the pandemic, global literacy rates are predicted to worsen.

### 2. How can literacy rates be improved?
[Easton (2014)]( https://inee.org/system/files/resources/UNESCO_Sustaining_Literacy_in_Africa-_Developing_a_Literate_Environment.pdf) found that some ways in which literate environments can be enhanced in Africa is by rethinking the roles and procedures of institutions involved in improving literacy rates and finding ways of giving voice to those working closer to the field. We argue that by raising awareness of the global disparities of literacy rates, it can increase the weight of the arguments of those working in nurturing literate environments. This is because the more people that are aware of the issue, the more likely those working in the field will be listened to.
[Richmond, Robinson and Sachs-Israel (2012)]( https://www.right-to-education.org/sites/right-to-education.org/files/resource-attachments/UNESCO_The_Global_Literacy_Challenge_2008_En.pdf) argue that the international community must seek innovative ways to assist marginalised populations to raise their literacy rates. They found that people learn best when literacy acquisition serves their particular needs and purposes, thus work to address literacy rates must take this into account. They write that the scale of funding for adult literacy is insufficient for the size of the task (many countries spend less than 1% of their national education budget on adult literacy), and that lack of adequate funding is the most important barrier to progress. This is because it severely limits the quality, scale, and sustainability of programs developed. Although the paper was written several years ago, as explained above, many of the same issues and disparities still remain. Thus, creating a product that can help to raise funds by linking to charities and raising awareness (as we aim to do) would be a useful contribution. Additionally, the authors argue that community engagement is one of the largest factors to improving literacy rates. By creating an educational resource for children, we are targeting the community level, by engaging the children as well as other stakeholders such as their parents and teachers in the issue.
Whilst [Murray (2021)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09669760.2021.1883816) denotes that reduced school attendance over the course of the pandemic is likely to have lowered literacy rates, they also suggest that the global shift of awareness has caused many people to reconsider what is valuable to them, including educators who work with children (who are part of our target user group). This suggests that people may be more receptive to learning about issues such as literacy rates, which they may have previously taken for granted as an issue that is largely solved in the modern world. It thus provides a good opportunity to promote an educational resource such as the one we propose to build, as its effectiveness may be enhanced by the global awakening highlighted by Murray.

### Conclusion
Overall, our literature review demonstrated that whilst there has been a general trend towards the lowering of illiteracy, there still remain large disparities. These inequalities are especially prevalent in poorer countries, and the improvement of educational resources leading to better literacy skills can help members of these populations to participate better in politics and the economy. To improve literacy rates globally, better funding is needed to address the scale of the problem and work towards developing more effective programs. Increasing awareness is one way in which funding for such programs can be raised, thus projects such as the one we have proposed can be a valuable contribution in this sense. Due to a global shift in sensitivity to issues people may not have been previously receptive to (because of the pandemic), this is arguably a good time to deploy an educative tool such as our website. This review therefore helped to solidify our understanding of what the current state of literacy rates is, the issues that surround it, and what our website can do to make meaningful added value.

## c. Clear definition of the problem. How does your project relate to the above? We will be marking the ability of your team to identify a worthwhile and important problem and clearly articulate the scope and challenge of the problem.

We have seen that literacy rates often translate into economic opportunity, and is often a prerequisite for tapping into wider networks of communication between people and a foundation on which to build further skills. The ability to read and write has throughout history allowed people to spread ideas and exercise power and influence. On the other side of the coin, literacy allows the consumption of ideas and the ability to engage with debates, and access to knowledge and learning, which ties into human dignity, and opportunities for spiritual enrichment. The problem of low literacy rates and insufficient access to education is very real, yet often understated, where many people underestimate the scale of the issue and falsely assume that this was a problem of the past that has largely been resolved. Often this can be because literacy rates data has been viewed as a whole, a positive global rising trend that may have obscured the remaining problem. The signficance of contrasts in global literacy rates, and the inequalities that they represent, has also not been highlighted in discussion about global inequalities. Access to education is intersectional in nature, where educational and social opportunities are available to differing degrees according to gender, race, economic status, caste, disabilities or special education needs, and identity. 

Against this backdrop, the resources currently available to communicate about global literacy rates is lacking. As described in the section above, surprisingly few map or globe-based data visualisations exist, and much of global literacy rates data is confined to dense databases using technical language maintained by international organisations or NGOs. The existing data visualisations make use of line graphs, scatter plots, bar charts, or 2D maps and rarely have interactive features. These often technical and dense presentations of the data may affect young people the most, and may be exacerbated by reportedly shorter attention spans of digital natives, the current generation exposed to technology from an early age. At the same time, young people will grow up to shape the future and therefore represent a demographic that cannot be overlooked in discussions about literacy. They also have recent experience with schooling and education, from which we may infer a personal link to the data.

The project will seek to fill this gap by providing an alternative data visualisation which responds to the brief of serious play, and seeks to make global literacy rates data interesting and fun, particularly for younger generations. The visualisation is interactive, allowing discovery of the data and hands-on opportunities to click and manipulate the globe, intended to engage the user. A 3D globe format was chosen given the global nature of the issue of illiteracy, making this a natural way to visualise the data and bring out disparities between countries. The project will also clarify trends and patterns in the data, which would otherwise be difficult to detect if it remains in the database. As such, national and regional differences will come to light, and it will be easier to identify areas with low literacy rates without much effort.
