## About the Project
*Name of product* 
*	Left Unread
 
*What is the serious problem being addressed?* 
*	A lack of understanding of the inequalities around the globe in terms of education (reading and writing at minimum).
*	Giving a new visualisations to what the numbers mean e.g. is 97% literacy rate bad at all? It might be if the 10 neighbouring countries are at 99% (just an example).

*Who is this going to help? What's the impact? What's the motivation?* 
*	Raising awareness of inequalities in literacy rates globally, ability to quickly identify gaps to inform programmes to address them 

*Who is going to use it? Why will they use it?* 
*	For everyone who are interested in literacy and education and would like to know more about education around the globe
*	The website will show the user important information of unbalanced literacy rates around the world, calling for the improvement of education in less developed regions.
*	Governments and NGOs could use them for analysis but probably mostly will be an educational tool

*How does the project integrate play?*
*	A visual and appealing design – visual way to display useful information

*What game/play mechanics will be being used?* 
*	Interactive element? E.g. ability to zone in on a particular area
*	Playful display of images

*How will the play or game element help?*
*	Through the use of innovative visuals
*	Combining colour and sound in a unique way to lean towards a more playful nature 
*	Make learning more interesting through playful elements/more likely to remember something that was a bit different/caught your eye

*What are you going to make?* 
*	A website showing the inequality in terms of education, with the ability of interacting in various ways, including but not limited in words, graphs, maps and sounds.
*	Links to charities/things you can do to help/more information about why literacy rates are how they are/how this impacts people
*	Interactive minigame simulating people being illiterate.

*What features will your project have? What is the scope of project?*
*	3D assets potentially, global coverage of literacy rates with further segmentation into gender and cultural reasons for lack of reading and writing skills. Can be expanded to provide regional analysis 

*What are the technical challenges? Are you using an external API/database?*
*	Will need to scrape the data from government/third sector websites or access government APIs to form the database for the project
*	Will need to figure out a way to present that data in a visually appealing way – also maintaining the innovative spirit, the website / informatic should not just be a recreation of what has been done before
*	How might we have used new mediums e.g. sound, colour, haptic touch to convey information?
*	How might someone who does not know how to read or write be able to understand the information?
 
*Will this be for mobile or desktop? (or both!)*
*	Desktop

## Issues: 
*	Simulating the data for those who are unable to read would be difficult 
*	How can we make it different to what already exists?

## Building on the Idea
### What have other sites done well? 
*	Displaying factual data in various forms e.g. tables, graphs, charts
*	Easy access to download the data 
*	Discussion and explanation of the method used to obtain this data 
*	Analysis of their data quality
*	Links to resources sometimes provided, fact sheets, NGO initiatives, etc
*	Easy access to individual country stats

### What have other sites done poorly? 
*	Analysis of the data not always well developed – lots there but not synthesised meaningfully
*	Making an interesting and interactive design with elements of playfulness

### How can we introduce a game element to the existing data?
*	Opportunity to interact with the data through interactive data visualisation – e.g. to access further info on country level data
*	Making the webapp accessible for people with visual impairments (e.g. Incorporation of sound) - could consider designing a website around requirements of visually impaired people (e.g. Responsive to keyboard input, improved image description, integrating with special software for navigating the web)
*	Potential ways of comparing life with ability to read and not?
*	Simulating not being able to read:
  *	Words/textual data scrambled/out of order
  *	Unfamiliar characters, Unicode or from other languages

### Additional Ideas: 
*	When entering the page, have an image aimed to simulate not being able to read, which then forms into a description of the problem and of what the web page is about
*	Then takes you to an interactive globe where the user can drag it around, click on different areas to see more detailed information
*	Inspiration: 
  *	 me too rising – visual display of literacy rates on countries e.g. brighter for areas with higher literacy rates? Colours? https://metoorising.withgoogle.com/ 
  *	Richard Mattka portfolio (look for inspiration in imagery and sound) https://richardmattka.com/ 
	* Visualizing countries by share of earth? https://www.visualcapitalist.com/countries-by-share-of-earths-surface/
* Look at for research in ways to use the earth to display data 
  *	https://zen.ly/ 
  *	https://paperplanes.world/
  *	http://news-lab-trends-experiment.appspot.com/
  *	https://music-globe.jtp.io/ 
  *	https://experiments.withgoogle.com/chrome/globe 
*	Making literacy one aspect of the visualization, once implemented, begin tackling other international issues, (food poverty, gender discrimination etc) in essence an interactive, international fact-file on a host of topics. 
*	Attached information could be: breakdown of data, links to charities that help, links to more information related to the area
  *	https://ourworldindata.org/literacy
  *	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_literacy_rate
  *	https://data.unicef.org/topic/education/literacy/
  *	https://literacytrust.org.uk/parents-and-families/adult-literacy/
  *	https://worldliteracyfoundation.org/ 
*	Use of sound? (e.g. voice of racism, me too rising, Richard Mattka Portfolio, Keep Portland Weird)
  *	https://voiceofracism.co.nz/
  *	https://www.midwam.com/en 
*	Could this respond to where the mouse is e.g. makes different sounds when the mouse is hovering over different areas
*	Louder sounds found countries with lower literacy rates – where the focus may need to be! 
*	Adding on to sound, we could make this a website friendly for those with visual impairments – hovering over different countries mentions the name of the country as well as a sound – depending on the volume the user may deduce the literacy rate levels of that country. 
*	Menu options in squiggles as well?
*	Different types of descriptions for different areas of literacy rates

### Who is our user?
*	People in school who need the data
*	If they were writing an essay, would they just go to our world in data, or something like that?
*	12-16 year olds, where they can grab facts about it and keeps it interesting, but they aren’t writing an academic paper
*	General public – people that are interested but don’t know much about the issue
*	Charities
*	Media (e.g. Ted talks)
*	Emphasis on making change, analysis aspect
*	Academics
*	Later stages of primary school and early high school

### Added value
*	Visualisation aspect
*	Evaluation of data – what do these numbers mean?
*	Interactive format – engagement with the data
*	Catered the evaluation of the data to our audience
