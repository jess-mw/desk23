## First draft of visualising the website

* User opens website 
* Start off with a blank page, then a book fades into view 
*	Book opens and letters appearing on the book (as if being written) 
*	Letters are scrambled completely 
*	After X amount of time, letters begin to unscramble 
*	Book says: Name of website and strap line 
*	Zoom in through the book and towards a tiny globe that grows bigger by the second 
*	You have in front of you a globe that is lit up in a dark environment (as if in space) with lights representing the countries and their literacy rates 
*	Hovering your mouse over certain countries will produce varying intensities of sound 
*	The intensity of sound and light are directly proportional to the literacy rate of the country 
*	User can spin the globe around, click on a country and bring up further information e.g: 
  *	Country name
  *	Timeline slider allowing the user to change the year / era
