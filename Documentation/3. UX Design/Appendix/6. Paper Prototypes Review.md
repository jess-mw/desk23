## Paper Prototypes Review
After having basic verbal evaluations of our idea, most of the team members created a paper prototype with their own visualisation
of what the website should look like. We then went through each idea and documented their pros and cons to select which elements 
from each design we really liked.

### [Paper prototype 1: Jessica - Globe](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/main/Documentation/3.%20UX%20Design/Prototyping/PaperPrototypes/paperprototype%20Jess.pdf)

| Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- |
| Simple, playful and effective | Similar models exist (albeit for different things) - not much innovation |
| Allows high level of interaction | Does it show why understanding literacy rates is important? |
| Use of colour / light intensity is a good visual method – caters to people who may be unable to read properly | Is it clear who the audience is? Who would it be interesting to? |
| Informative and easy to understand the info being displayed | Not clear how the data would be displayed |
| Multiple ways to interact with the model – visual, sound, touch | Can you compare data? What is the data supposed to help us with? |
| Good balance between text, images and sound – not purely data focused – ideal for younger people | Not transferrable to other issues (if we choose to expand scope) |

### Paper prototype 2: Emily - Unscrambled Homepage
https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/e4edbc3840e857b8ccaa83b1b3388358b92503ee/DesignElements/PaperPrototypes/Paper%20prototype%20Emily.pdf
| Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- |
| A good way to add a playful element into a serious topic | Might be difficult to integrate the playful elements with the more serious ones |
| Can be used to as a loading screen effect when added to a data heavy topic | Possible complex API for scrambling individual characters |
| Unscrambling of words playful and a good idea that can be carried through the website – tackles the serious element and the play well | Animations required might be difficult to do  |
| A more direct way of showing what might be like if unable to read | |
| Not too complex for target audience, should help to engage them | |

### Paper prototype 3: Emily - Mini Survey
(see previous link)
| Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- |
| Simple and fun! Allows users to learn about themselves without going to a database website and using ctrl + f to search up their own countries | Might be too simple? At least with regards to front-end and UI/UX |
| Blends with other ideas well – can be added to other conceptions | People might be reticent to give out location/personal data |
| Leading on from the idea that it might be too simple, this could be effective if our target audience and younger people | People might want to see all data (not just personalised data) |
| | Less directly linked to the topic of literacy rates than some of the other options being explored |

### Paper prototype 4: Emily - Storybook
(see previous link)
| Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- |
| Appealing to target audience | Is it easy to implement? |
| Good way of interactive for kids (and attractive) |  How would the story book link with the globe data? |
| Could use the book idea to display the homepage on I.e. when entering the website, the scrambled words & description is presented on a book – makes it more playful | Information limited on a certain page --- can be expanded though |
| | Every time you would open the page, it would repeat the same story book intro  |

### Paper prototype 5: Wenda - Game
https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/e4edbc3840e857b8ccaa83b1b3388358b92503ee/DesignElements/PaperPrototypes/paperprototype_wenda.pdf
| Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- |
| A lot of playful elements – strong link to the project brief | Complex and time consuming to build the game |
| Timeline aspect is good | Need to define cohesive storyline of how different parts of the website fit together |
| Original idea – game aspect most evident here | How do we determine what difficulty a game should be in relation to the literacy of a country? |
| Appealing to target audience | Targeted audience yet to decide – public or more specific? |
| Illustrates/refers to the importance of the issue the most – combination of serious and play | A lot of web page switches (not sure what it would be called) - might be difficult to integrate within a single page web application |
| Puts you in the situation directly as the user to experience real-life scenarios where reading is important - might build empathy | |

### Paper prototype 6: Hamza - Lightbulbs
https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/e4edbc3840e857b8ccaa83b1b3388358b92503ee/DesignElements/PaperPrototypes/Lights%20and%20Literacy%20-%20Paper%20Prototype.pdf
| Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- |
| Innovative and new method of visualising as well as accessing the data  | Different monitors may display varying luminance of the bulbs i.e it may be difficult to see the lights |
| Purely interactive | 3D world may be difficult to render in real time on a website |
| Has a strong playful element embedded into the website | Unsure of the simplicity or difficulty of allowing a user to walk around in a 3D space on a website |
| Simple concept that requires few assets i.e a 3D globe, 195 light bulbs and 3D text assets | Prevents the user from comparing data between countries |
| Inside instead of outside globe very creative and different to other existing ideas | More challenges in implementation |
