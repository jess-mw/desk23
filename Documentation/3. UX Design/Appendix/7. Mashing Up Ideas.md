## Mashing Up Ideas

We ran this exercise with the intent of exploring different design possibilities for our idea, 
to encourage creativity and thinking outside the box.
We inputted various ideas we had come up with in our paper prototypes into a website generator that randomly put them together.
Using the random mash-ups, we all came up with ideas relating to these aspects that could be put into a website design.
After the random generators, we created some custom mash-ups.
We then collectively outlined a first draft visualising what the website will look like.
