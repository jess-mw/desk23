# UX Design

## a. Mashing Up the Serious and The Playful

Our objective was to create a single page web application that combines a serious and playful topic. In our very first session as a group, we held a mash-up activity. See here for more information on the session: [Mash up Session](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/main/Documentation/3.%20UX%20Design/Appendix/1.%20Ideation%20Grid.md). 

With a narrowed down selection of ideas, we proceeded to analysing each one by asking a series of difficult questions. The ideas were broken down, and different team members provided their input and vision on how the end-product may look. See here for more information on the session: [Analysing the Ideas](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/main/Documentation/3.%20UX%20Design/Appendix/2.%20Analysing%20the%20Ideas.md).

The four concepts in contention were then ranked by each member, where a rank 1 equated to 4 points, and a rank of 4 equated to 1 point (inversely related). We found our winner; Literacy Rates.  


## b. Breaking the Problem Down

Before focussing on who our end user will be, we decided to understand the problem at hand by throwing in several ideas on what the end product may look like. How might we display the disparities of literacy rates in a playful manner? Have other websites aimed to tackle the problem in a similar manner? How can we build on the positives as well as the negatives of existing solutions? See here for details on the analysis of the concept: [Building on the Idea](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/main/Documentation/3.%20UX%20Design/Appendix/3.%20Literacy%20Rates%20-%20Ideation%20Phase.md).

At this stage, we have a problem to solve and we also have a selection of playful methods that can be incorporated into solving the serious problem.  In order to choose the most appropriate playful elements of the website, we needed to begin understanding who are our end users will be. 

## c. Who is Our User?

In the previous sections we outlined the route we took to decide that the disparity of literacy rates of various countries was an issue we are aiming to tackle. In particular, we are looking at how literacy rates are represented and how might we develop a better visual representation for them. This was essential in order to highlight the stark differences between continents such as Europe and Asia. 

Our target user is going to be Children and Adolescents between the ages of 12 – 16. See here for details on how we selected our target user: [The User](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/main/Documentation/3.%20UX%20Design/Appendix/10.%20The%20User.md).

We acknowledged, however, that one particular group of people would not be the only ones utilising our website and/or being impacted by it. 
The group proceeded to hold a discussion on who our stakeholders would be (primary and secondary), resulting in us developing an in-depth stakeholder analysis. 


### Stakeholder Analysis 

The stakeholder analysis was done in order to maximise the possible contribution of the project and anticipate the various interactions with other parties to be cognizant of the impacts, including ethical considerations. After initial brainstorming, mapping primary and secondary stakeholders and their possible interests and concerns, this chart was produced using Miro (see below) to demonstrate how stakeholders would be managed over the course of the project.

Stakeholders with high influence and high interest in the project include the target user (students/adolescents), the team itself (given a vested interest in the website’s success), and the University of Bristol as the locus of the project (including any potential reputational risks), and were deemed to require close engagement. In particular, given the educational nature of the website, the team agreed it would key to make sure that the website would be an inclusive and safe space for students of all abilities and backgrounds to navigate.

Next, the team considered others in the immediate circle of the student, including family and friends, and, critically, teachers who would need to be kept informed – in particular given their responsibility to safeguard their students and their role in potentially directing students to the website as an educational tool. Research participants, including users interacting with the surveys and making up the focus group, were also considered to fall in this category. The team considered it would be critical to seek out a diverse group of participants to ensure balanced responses; to make sure the survey would be designed not to be overly invasive; and, fundamentally, to protect the data collected. 

The awareness raising component of the website, from the general nature of the topic being treated, to any more specific links or resources provided on the page, could potentially implicate secondary stakeholders, including NGOs and charities. In directing traffic towards their causes, it would be important to scrutinise any organisations before listing them on the website to make sure users are directed to valid charities and to avoid inadvertently propagating scams. 

Other secondary stakeholders could include policymakers and international development partners looking for effective communication tools about literacy rates. 

It was noted that, though the website itself does not collect data from users, we would need to consider where we source our data from to ensure accuracy and consider attribution and any related licensing issues. In this respect, the data owners would need to be kept satisfied, and data properly referenced. Given that they could decide at any moment to restrict access to their data, the data owners were considered to have high power.


## d. The Design Methodology 

### What Could the Website Look Like?

The first step our group took was to conceptualise several paper prototypes using various techniques such as story and mood boards. The idea was to quickly put together visuals to give an idea on what we, on an individual basis, think would best combine the seriousness of literacy rate disparities with something playful. Upon doing so, created a brief list of pros and cons for everyone’s designs. To see our early prototypes as well as their analysis please see here: [Paper Prototypes](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/main/Documentation/3.%20UX%20Design/Appendix/6.%20Paper%20Prototypes%20Review.md).

Our next design choice was to find the most effective way to pull out the best of all ideas and combine them. We decided to use the mash-up technique once more, this time forcing together 3 ideas at a time and creating strange yet interesting solution, which you may view here: [Mashing Up the Ideas](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/main/Documentation/3.%20UX%20Design/Appendix/7.%20Mashing%20Up%20Ideas.md).

We knew that a majority of our concepts would not gel together well, however, realised that there may be a hidden gem or quality that would be put to use in the later stages of our project. 
The final mash-up we did was between a timeline of literacy rate changes throughout the years for each country and a map to display said data in a playful and interactive manner. Having narrowed down to just one idea, we began fleshing it out. Please click here to check out the first draft of our website: [First Written Draft of Website](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/main/Documentation/3.%20UX%20Design/Appendix/11.%20%20First%20draft%20of%20website.md). 

Having the website’s process and user journey down on paper allowed us to begin working on iterations of paper prototypes of the website. We had two prototypes, one allowing the user to traverse along a 2D map of the earth, and the second allowing the user to spin through a 3D Globe representation of the earth. To view the two prototypes, click here: [First Two Website Prototypes](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/main/Documentation/3.%20UX%20Design/Appendix/8.%20First%20Two%20Website%20Prototypes.md).


### First Survey Findings

Please click here to view the most important results from our survey: [Survey Monkey Results](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/tree/main/Documentation/3.%20UX%20Design/Feedback/First%20SurveyMonkey%20Results).

With the two website prototypes, the next step was to develop a survey to cast the net wider to collect insights, validate fundamental assumptions underpinning the project, and inform the design. The survey was created using SurveyMonkey and shared with the team’s networks. We used social media as a means of sharing and spreading the survey, attempting to garner the most responses possible so that we can truly understand where the majority leans when analysing the data. The form included 10 multiple choice or free form questions geared towards understanding user preferences for data representation (based on the paper prototype) to augment the user experience, and gathering information on pre-existing knowledge about global literacy rates. The team analysed the 26 responses received and sought to take into account the feedback as the paper prototype was transformed into a Wireframe using Adobe XD. The survey results confirmed that an interactive globe would be a more interesting way to represent data, versus a tabular format or a static map. When selecting from a list where multiple options were permitted, 21 respondents (84 percent) said an interactive visualization would enhance the user experience, and 16 (64 percent) said it would be a fun and playful approach. Importantly, 18 (72 percent) said that it offers an improved understanding of what the data represents, a key assumption behind the educational aspect of the website.

Many respondents pointed out that a static 2D map would be easy to navigate and allow better comparison across regions of the globe since they could all be visible at once, however it would also limit user interaction and engagement, and could be dated and potentially lacking in novelty. On the other hand, the interactive 3D globe approach could risk being less user friendly, respondents found, but would be more exciting and potentially create a sense of exploration and discovery as the globe is traversed and rotated. The 3D globe was ultimately preferred by 71% of respondents.

Finally, only 20% of respondents correctly estimated the proportion of the world's population aged 15 years and above that is able to read and write today, and interestingly the majority of respondents reported being “somewhat confident” or “not so confident” about their ability to accurately estimate the proportion of their country's population that is literate, and how these rates compare to the global average, underscoring the necessity of such a tool.

### User Particpatory Design 

With the data leaning heavily towards creating a 3D interactive globe to represent the literacy rates data from various different years, we were able to begin developing wireframes for the prototype. 
In order to build a website that truly adheres to the user’s needs and expectations, we decided to enrol users co-designers. Whilst we could not involve all stakeholders identified within our design process (due to COVID limitations), we were able to obtain a diverse group of varying nationalities as well as ages comprised of the team’s friends and family. Please see our ethics section to understand how we incorporated our ethical framework into the remainder of the design process.
The group looked to approaching the design through a Heuristic Evaluation lens and decided to use Gerhardt-Powals’ heuristic evaluation principles as the backbone of the development of our designs. See here for an outline of the 9 principles we referred to: https://www.liquisearch.com/heuristic_evaluation/gerhardt-powals%E2%80%99_cognitive_engineering_principles
This design method fit perfectly with out Agile SCRUM development process. Having a group of users whom we could consistently share our designs and updates with, who in turn provided us with valuable feedback on potential improvements, allowed us to elegantly run the agile development cycle. The website was in a constant process of being pushed to production and tested by our user group.
