# UX Design

## a. Mashing Up the Serious and The Playful

Our objective was to create a single page web application that combines a serious and playful topic. In our very first session as a group, we held a mash-up activity. See here for more information on the session: [Mash up Session](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/main/Documentation/3.%20UX%20Design/Appendix/1.%20Ideation%20Grid.md). 

With a narrowed down selection of ideas, we proceeded to analysing each one by asking a series of difficult questions. The ideas were broken down, and different team members provided their input and vision on how the end-product may look. See here for more information on the session: [Analysing the Ideas](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/main/Documentation/3.%20UX%20Design/Appendix/2.%20Analysing%20the%20Ideas.md).

The four concepts in contention were then ranked by each member, where a rank 1 equated to 4 points, and a rank of 4 equated to 1 point (inversely related). We found our winner; Literacy Rates.  


## b. Breaking the Problem Down

Before focussing on who our end user will be, we decided to understand the problem at hand by throwing in several ideas on what the end product may look like. How might we display the disparities of literacy rates in a playful manner? Have other websites aimed to tackle the problem in a similar manner? How can we build on the positives as well as the negatives of existing solutions? See here for details on the analysis of the concept: [Building on the Idea](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/main/Documentation/3.%20UX%20Design/Appendix/3.%20Literacy%20Rates%20-%20Ideation%20Phase.md).

At this stage, we have a problem to solve and we also have a selection of playful methods that can be incorporated into solving the serious problem.  In order to choose the most appropriate playful elements of the website, we needed to begin understanding who are our end users will be. 

## Who is Our User?

In the previous sections we outlined the route we took to decide that the disparity of literacy rates of various countries was an issue we are aiming to tackle. In particular, we are looking at how literacy rates are represented and how might we develop a better visual representation for them. This was essential in order to highlight the stark differences between continents such as Europe and Asia. 

Our target user is going to be Children and Adolescents between the ages of 12 â€“ 16. See here for details on how we selected our target user: [The User](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/main/Documentation/3.%20UX%20Design/Appendix/10.%20The%20User.md).

We acknowledged, however, that one particular group of people would not be the only ones utilising our website and/or being impacted by it. 
The group proceeded to hold a discussion on who our stakeholders would be (primary and secondary), resulting in us developing an in-depth stakeholder analysis. 


## Stakeholder Analysis 

The stakeholder analysis was done in order to maximise the possible contribution of the project and anticipate the various interactions with other parties to be cognizant of the impacts, including ethical considerations. After initial brainstorming, mapping primary and secondary stakeholders and their possible interests and concerns, this chart was produced using Miro (see below) to demonstrate how stakeholders would be managed over the course of the project.
