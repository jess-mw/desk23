# UX Design

## a. Mashing Up the Serious and The Playful

Our objective was to create a single page web application that combines a serious and playful topic. In our very first session as a group, we held a mash-up activity. See here for more information on the session: [Mash up Session](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/main/Documentation/3.%20UX%20Design/Appendix/1.%20Ideation%20Grid.md). 

With a narrowed down selection of ideas, we proceeded to analysing each one by asking a series of difficult questions. The ideas were broken down, and different team members provided their input and vision on how the end-product may look. See here for more information on the session: [Analysing the Ideas](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/main/Documentation/3.%20UX%20Design/Appendix/2.%20Analysing%20the%20Ideas.md).

The four concepts in contention were then ranked by each member, where a rank 1 equated to 4 points, and a rank of 4 equated to 1 point (inversely related). We found our winner; Literacy Rates.  


## b. Breaking the Problem Down

Before focussing on who our end user will be, we decided to understand the problem at hand by throwing in several ideas on what the end product may look like. How might we display the disparities of literacy rates in a playful manner? Have other websites aimed to tackle the problem in a similar manner? How can we build on the positives as well as the negatives of existing solutions? See here for details on the analysis of the concept: [Building on the Idea](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/main/Documentation/3.%20UX%20Design/Appendix/3.%20Literacy%20Rates%20-%20Ideation%20Phase.md).

At this stage, we have a problem to solve and we also have a selection of playful methods that can be incorporated into solving the serious problem.  In order to choose the most appropriate playful elements of the website, we needed to begin understanding who are our end users will be. 

## Who is Our User?

In the previous sections we outlined the route we took to decide that the disparity of literacy rates of various countries was an issue we are aiming to tackle. In particular, we are looking at how literacy rates are represented and how might we develop a better visual representation for them. This was essential in order to highlight the stark differences between continents such as Europe and Asia. 

Our target user is going to be Children and Adolescents between the ages of 12 – 16. See here for details on how we selected our target user: [The User](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/main/Documentation/3.%20UX%20Design/Appendix/10.%20The%20User.md).

We acknowledged, however, that one particular group of people would not be the only ones utilising our website and/or being impacted by it. 
The group proceeded to hold a discussion on who our stakeholders would be (primary and secondary), resulting in us developing an in-depth stakeholder analysis. 


## Stakeholder Analysis 

The stakeholder analysis was done in order to maximise the possible contribution of the project and anticipate the various interactions with other parties to be cognizant of the impacts, including ethical considerations. After initial brainstorming, mapping primary and secondary stakeholders and their possible interests and concerns, this chart was produced using Miro (see below) to demonstrate how stakeholders would be managed over the course of the project.

Stakeholders with high influence and high interest in the project include the target user (students/adolescents), the team itself (given a vested interest in the website’s success), and the University of Bristol as the locus of the project (including any potential reputational risks), and were deemed to require close engagement. In particular, given the educational nature of the website, the team agreed it would key to make sure that the website would be an inclusive and safe space for students of all abilities and backgrounds to navigate.

Next, the team considered others in the immediate circle of the student, including family and friends, and, critically, teachers who would need to be kept informed – in particular given their responsibility to safeguard their students and their role in potentially directing students to the website as an educational tool. Research participants, including users interacting with the surveys and making up the focus group, were also considered to fall in this category. The team considered it would be critical to seek out a diverse group of participants to ensure balanced responses; to make sure the survey would be designed not to be overly invasive; and, fundamentally, to protect the data collected. 

The awareness raising component of the website, from the general nature of the topic being treated, to any more specific links or resources provided on the page, could potentially implicate secondary stakeholders, including NGOs and charities. In directing traffic towards their causes, it would be important to scrutinise any organisations before listing them on the website to make sure users are directed to valid charities and to avoid inadvertently propagating scams. 

Other secondary stakeholders could include policymakers and international development partners looking for effective communication tools about literacy rates. 

It was noted that, though the website itself does not collect data from users, we would need to consider where we source our data from to ensure accuracy and consider attribution and any related licensing issues. In this respect, the data owners would need to be kept satisfied, and data properly referenced. Given that they could decide at any moment to restrict access to their data, the data owners were considered to have high power.
