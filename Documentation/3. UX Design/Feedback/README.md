# Interview methodology
## Objectives

The intention with all the feedback meetings was to gather user evaluation about our prototype to inform the design process and analyse what we needed to change or focus on, as well as bring up issues that we may not have been able to see ourselves. Before conducting the feedback sessions, we scoped a ballpark for the problem space that we were looking at, then used interviews to interrogate this further.

## Ethics

The user was informed previous to the session that we would not store any sensitive information about them, and they could withdraw their data at any time (they were given a contact email with which to do this). They were also presented with our ethical framework, and given a university address to contact if they felt we were in breach. We also tried to mitigate bias in our questions, by educating ourselves about leading questions and avoiding these in interview settings.

## Interview Strategy

The feedback sessions were kept short to avoid question fatigue, and we focused on allowing the user to guide the interview, adapting our questions according with the direction they were going in, thus using a semi-structured interview strategy. We had some well thought out questions for which to give the interview direction, but also allowed for a great deal of breathing room to allow the interview to take its own natural course.  The interviews were structured with a beginning (to allow people to warm up and get comfortable), a middle, and an end. We tried to funnel questions, starting with broad topics and then probing depth as the answer developed. Whilst the user was answering, we tried to say as little as possible to allow the user to answer without influence. We refrained from jumping in to help participants, only stepping in if they had already made several attempts to solve an issue without success. If the participant encountered an issue, instead of immediately trying to help, we asked them to think aloud to give insight into how they conceptualised the problem.

## Outline of Session Methodology

Initially, the users that had not previously seen the website were presented with the prototypes/products without instruction, and their behaviour was observed by the interviewer without interruption (only responding if the participant asked questions). The purpose of this was to observe behaviour as uninfluenced by any researcher bias as possible. For earlier prototypes, slightly more guidance was required as to how to navigate as interactivity was not properly developed yet, but this was minimised.
After using the system and playing around with various movements, the interviewer explained to them the project brief and outline, and gathered any feedback the users may have had in relation to this. The users were then asked to complete a short questionnaire gathering some qualitative data before being debriefed.

For the subsequent feedback sessions, we employed a similar strategy of dropping the users in the deep end. The goal was to discover all the bugs that may not have been anticipated during the design period. Making notes on actions such as where the user clicks, how many times and where does their mouse venture the most. After this, general feedback was gathered on their experience. After which, we obtained feedback on the actual design e.g. what did the user think of our use of colours? Use of text? 

## Impact of Covid

Due to the global pandemic, these interview sessions were split into two main formats: in-person, or virtual. Whilst the in-person sessions (conducted with members of our bubbles) were administratively easier to conduct, and behaviour was easier to observe, there may have been some impact of bias. For example, we were only able to conduct in-person sessions with members of our bubbles, and this thus increases the likelihood of bias or pre-conceptions about the project. Sessions conducted via zoom had additional issues to do with connection failure, or problems with sound quality that may have impacted the data collected.
