# Feedback on MVP
### Feedback on 15/04/2021

### How the session was conducted:
This session was conducted in person, but the audio was recorded with the user’s consent for later reference. The user had not participated in the previous sessions. They were briefed and the project scope was explained to them. They were shown the prototype and left to interact with it whilst the interviewer observed, answering any questions the user had. After interacting with it, we spoke about any feedback they had.

### User 4:
**Interviewer’s Observations**

1. User needed little guidance to interact with the globe, timeline, and arrows.

2. Moved the timeline around but didn’t really like not being able to fully move it from one end to the other – wanted to keep it scrolling more

**User's feedback**

1. Globe as it currently stands is a little difficult to interact with, the arrows should be changed to something simpler

2. The timeline should show which year it is currently in, rather than jumping from one end to the other

3. Good for (school) years 7-8, older students might look for a few minutes and then get bored

4. Should make the content engaging and easy to read – try and avoid information overload 

5. The more countries we have information about the better – annoying when it is Western-centric

7. The moon is a nice touch

### Potential Areas to Improve:
1. The moon or the sun could be our slider! If we can figure out a way to create a curved slider over the top of the globe that is...
2. Perhaps the arrows could be made more simple, and should only exist as hints rather than usable items? 
3. Try to bring the website to life – incorporate small, interactive movements as this would make it more engaging
4. Make clearer the connection between the book and the globe floating in space. Discuss as a group the theme that we really want to highlight.
5. Transitions between website features could be clarified- how does the landing page switch to the book? How do the letters unscramble? How do we go from viewing the book to the globe?
6. Perhaps have a key to explain what the different colours mean (if we are displaying the countries in different colours)
7. Could make it clearer what the timeline is for/does
