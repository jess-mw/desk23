# Feedback on MVP
### Feedback on 06/05/2021

### How the session was conducted:
This session was conducted in person, but the audio was recorded with the user’s consent for later reference. The user had not participated in the previous sessions. They were briefed with ethics before the session. The project scope was explained to them after the user was left a while to interact with the website without guidance. They were shown the prototype and left to interact with it whilst the interviewer observed, answering any questions the user had. After interacting with it, we spoke about any feedback they had. The user was then explained the project brief and objectives, and we had a further discussion about any thoughts they had after being informed more.

### User 4:
**Interviewer’s Observations**

1. User was a bit unsure about what to do at the start, but they did not need guidance to interact with the globe/move it around, and some of the features included to help with useability (e.g. hand and arrow gifs) did more to confuse than clarify.
3. User liked moving the timeline around a lot, and seeing how the bar charts changed. They liked how far back in time the data went to.
4. It was not initially clear to the user what the height of the bar indicated.
5. User liked to click on countries, moving the globe around a lot.
6. User liked to go to obscure countries and look at the data there.
7. User didn't understand why some bars were going different colours, but when it was explained to them they thought it was a nice feature - they liked being able to know where you've looked. Perhaps this feature could be kept but explained more.
8. User got a bit held up on why the bars were where they are, and if they could be moved around.


**User's feedback**

1. Current simplicity is good, shouldn't overload or add too much extra information (especially for the user group).
2. Could we explain the data a bit more? Is it of adults or children? What is the definition of literate being used?
3. Could have labels at each end of the timeline to show the first and last years.
4. It's nice to see how things change over time.
5. In areas where there are a lot of countries (e.g. Europe), it is difficult to see which data is for which countries - it would be good if you could zoom in here to make the separation clearer.
6. Other information, e.g. population, might be interesting to look at in addition to the basic data.
7. If literacy rates is something in the curriculum, this is a resource that would be better used at schools - is it something kids would use at home?
8. Perhaps look at other data sets to fill in the missing data.
9. Perhaps if there's a year with no data, you can't select that year on the timeline - you can only select years that have data collected for them. Maybe explain this in the info box next to the timeline.
10. Don't make it too cluttered by adding too much information.

### Potential Areas to Improve:
1. Percentage signs need to be included next to the number for clarification, also explain that it is the percentage of literate people.
2. Explain why there is missing data.
3. Info box with literacy data is too big & obscures the globe.
4. Display of data in this box could be streamlined and made clearer - don't need to say "literacy rates" twice, but do need to explain what the number is.
5. Should explain more about the data in terms of where it comes from as well.
