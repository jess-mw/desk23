# Thematic Analysis for Feedback Session 4 Participant 5 
In order to observe the usability of the website as well as to improve user experience, a series of feedback session and thematic analysis is needed. The feedback session was conducted in person, with audio recorded with the user’s consent for later reference. The user had not participated in the previous sessions and were briefed with ethics before the session. 
## Procedure
The participant was shown the prototype and left to interact with it without guidance for a while whilst the interviewer observing the process, answering any questions the user had. after that, the project scope was explained and the user could give as much feedback as they desire. The participant was then given more details about the project brief and objectives, and discussed if there were any thoughts when being informed more.
##  Results
The thematic analysis process applied to the transcripts elicited key concepts that were evident in the data. These themes are viewed as essential in determining the understandings of the participant, and the categories are defined as Interactive Is Good, Detailed not Cluttered separately. Although some aspects may overlap across the themes, this is regarded as positive as all aspects are relative to each other. 
###  Interactive Is Good
The participant liked to interact with globe and look at literacy data. Even a bit unsure what to do at very beginning, the user quickly found the right way to interact with globe without guidance and felt it easy.
> P – (reading the instructions out loud) spin the globe in any direction by clicking and dragging. Well that’s quite easy. That’s cool. 

Using timeline bar to change the year is also easy to use during the observation, and the user enjoyed the experience to observe how the literacy rates changed overtime. However, it is suggested that the slider might could simply skip the years without data.

> P – (reading the instructions out loud) drag the slider left or right to change which year we are currently in. That’s pretty cool. Well I’m going to go back to the beginning then. 

> ---

> P – Maybe, I don’t know if this will be too difficult, if you’ve got a year where there’s missing data, maybe when you slide the slider it can’t, it will only let you stop on places where you’ve got data. 

The user was unsure what causing some bar colour showing literacy rates will change, but when explained to them this was the one user clicked it became very easy to use. This might not be a problem as most interactive websites provide similar features, but a simple explanation would do better.

> P – yeah. Why are there some red bars? 

> I – that’s what you’ve clicked on. 

> P – ah ok 

> I – they might not be in the final one 

> P – that’s probably useful, because you know where you’ve looked. 

Also, the user wished to have more interaction with globe and literacy bars, such as zooming in for closer look at the bars, moving them around and showing literacy data in different colour. 

> P – I wonder do you think like the number could be highlighted, or a different colour, or something, because that’s the number that’s the most important thing isn’t it? … Are these just stuck randomly, somewhere in the country (talking about the bars)? 

> I – they’ll be stuck where the coordinates for that country are. 

> P – ok, so maybe that’s kind of like the centre of Canada somehow. Maybe if you go to the southerly, westerly, northerly it sticks it somewhere there. 

> ---

> P – can you, or do you need to, oh you said to use fingers to zoom in and out. But I can’t do that (as they are using it on a desktop). I’m just thinking, like if you wanted to look at Europe for example. Looking at that, you would just want to zoom out on it a bit, but you can’t do that on here. 
### Detailed not Cluttered
Overall, the user is able to figure out how to use the website and read literacy rates from it, but suggesting more useful guidance would be helpful. User found out it is difficult to understand the meaning of bar heights and lacking year indication on timeline.
> P – Does the height of the bar, is that significant? 

> I – um, yeah, those are the literacy rates 

> P – yeah but the bar is higher if the literacy rate is higher, is that it?
 
> I – yes 

> ---

> P – I don’t know if, you can click to see where the timeline starts and finishes, I don’t know if you need a label, to say it’s 1900 at that end and 2008 at that end. 

Also, user suggested more explanation to the data, as well as make it easier to read with a round percent, for example, change 89.234897329 to 89.2%.

> P – Brazil. Literacy rate 68. What does that mean? 68 what? 

> I – percent 

> P – I think, maybe if you gave a round percent? You need to give a percent, and 89.234897329 might be too many decimal places. Maybe you just need to round up to one decimal places. 

As there were some blank years without literacy rate data, the user suggested filling up the missing data, as well as related information (source, influence of literacy rates, etc.) 

> P –It’s like, there’s a lot of missing data, so it’s kind of, you can’t sort of, because for now, 1945, there’s not information for every year is there? And not for every country? So I don’t know why that is. So it might be questioned why that is. And there might be a particular reason for that. Is the data coming from a particular source? 

>---

> P – Why does it say to view its literacy rates and other data? What other data? Are you going to put something else in there? 

Meanwhile, too much information will be difficult to read for adolescents, which requires a delicate balance between detailing and cluttering. This also indicates the size of box showing data should be adjusted.

> P – well to me that would be interesting, but I’m not 11-14. But then they’re getting a bit more information from it, I suppose. Do you think this box is too big? (points to the box that comes up when you click on a country) 
## Conclusion
The results highlighted some useful feedback from user, showing although a user could interact with the globe correctly without guidance, there are some aspects which need to be improved for better user experience. It can be estimated that given more suitable guidance and detailed information/introduction about the UI the potential users should feel easier to interact with globe and look through the data.
