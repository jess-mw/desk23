<h1> First Prototype of Website (non paper prototype) - Globe 1 produced using three.js</h1>

<h2> Feedback Gathered on: 28/04/2021</h2>

Session 3 of Feedback 

Now testing the first version of the globe as seen below:

Focus Group: 2 Candidates  
 

<h3>User feedback:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The green orbs look unappealing and weird / distracting. 
      <ol><li>Despite this, it does make clicking on the countries easier (as the entire country is not clickable). </li> </ol>
  </li>

<li>Website is slightly choppy. </li>

<li>Show and hide tutorial buttons seem to be misplaced at the top of the website, bottom corners would be more suitable.  </li>

<li>Tutorials should be more informative and with less text – use images (didn’t you have arrows in your previous prototypes? They were nice!).  </li>

<li>The skybox makes for a much more interesting background – enjoy the fact that it moves when you spin the globe.  </li>

<li>All the colour combinations are off – no apparent colour scheme.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Interviewer’s Observations: </h3>

<ol>
  <li>First thing that users tested was the globe – ignoring the tutorial </li>

<li>It is possible that they have come across similar products before, so already had an understanding of how the globe should move. </li>

<li>Given that, it is good to note that the globe responded well to their expectations.  </li>

<li>If their mouse click was released on a certain country, it would be selected. This was not their intention, rather a bug in the code. Users did not complain though. </li>

<li>User tested the slider and it worked seamlessly.  </li>
</ol>

<h2> Feedback Gathered on: 29/04/2021</h2>

Focus Group: 1 Candidate
 
The feedback session took place remotely using Zoom. 

<h3>User feedback:</h3>

<ol>

<li>The globe is eyecatching and the land in particular is very realistic, looks a bit 3D. </li>

<li>Slight website lag detected - could be due to the Zoom screensharing. </li>

<li>Doesn't feel like our Earth - might help to add the moon in within the 360 view.  </li>

<li>Big changes in the sky in the background (from darker to brighter areas) as it moves may draw attention away from the Earth </li>

<li>Liked that the globe doesn't show borders between countries
  <ol><li>Makes countries seem closer by, and borders seem to matter less, may help to highlight disparities in literacy rates, particularly between neighbours </li> 
    <li>Makes literacy rates a less political, more global issue  </li> </ol>
</li>

<li>Noted that the blue of the ocean is not very realistic, while the background and land are photorealistic- found this difficult to reconcile and a little jarring </li>
</ol>


<h3>Interviewer’s Observations: </h3>

<ol><li>Could control the globe intuitively without guidance</li>
  <li>Seemed to enjoy clicking on the globe and kept manipulating it throughout the interview</li>
  </ol>

  <h2> Feedback Gathered on: 2/05/2021</h2>

Focus Group: 1 Candidate
 
The feedback session took place in-person as a one-to-one interview.

<h3>User feedback:</h3>

<ol>

<li>The user found the globe and background cool, noted that the colour of the sea is not as nice as the rest. </li>

<li>Slight website lag detected. </li>

<li>Half the globe is empty - Pacific missing any country names/data points, might make globe less interesting to interact with on the whole. </li>

<li>Borders between countries would be nice - it would be easier to select based on the shape. </li>

<li>Could make the cursor change to a hand to make it clear to the user when things are clickable. </li>

<li> Zoom issues noticed - pixelated when zooming in (would make it very difficult to engage with smaller countries), scrolling is at the same speed when zoomed in leading to big and very fast jumps between countries.</li>

<li>Slider can be more prominent and dates clarified - start/end date, where you are at any given time could be indicated with an arrow</li>
</ol>


<h3>Interviewer’s Observations: </h3>

<ol><li>Could control the globe intuitively without guidance</li>
  <li>Took some time to discover that it was possible to zoom in on the globe.</li>
  <li>Clicked on "Show Tutorial" even when already showing - hadn't noticed the instruction boxes yet.</li>
  <li>Noticed the slider last. Tried clicking on the box showing the date to interact with the slider, tried to enter the year into the box with keyboard (not supported). </li>
  </ol>

<h3>Areas for Improvement: </h3>

<ol><li>Revisit the colour/texture of the ocean areas of the globe </li>
  <li>Consider balance in attention to globe vs background - want the data to stand out </li>
  <li>Consider how to make the Earth feel more familiar, less alien - texture change to the ocean may already help with this for example </li>
   <li>Address bug with click release causing country to be selected, potential lag/choppiness </li>
  <li>Introduce unified colour scheme based on colour palettes in paper prototyping phase</li>
  <li>Introduce arrows and improve placement and formatting of tutorial elements to make them more visible - draw attention to zoom functionality </li>
  <li>Experiment with alternative ways to represent the data (alternatives to green orbs)</li>
   <li>Improve quality of image for zoom functionality</li>
  <li>Show the range of data (start and end dates) in the slider</li>
  </ol>


<h1> First Prototype of Website (non paper prototype) - Globe 2 produced using D3</h1>


<h2> Feedback Gathered on: 29/04/2021</h2>

Focus Group: 1 Candidate
 
The feedback session took place remotely using Zoom, at the same time as the interview for the three.js website prototype (Globe 1).

<h3>User feedback:</h3>

<ol>

<li>Found the globe sleek and minimal, with a certain level of abstraction to it. </li>

<li>Liked the red/black colour palette. </li>

<li>Thought the globe was appearing off-centre, and wondering if something was missing to the left of the globe, eg. if any information would appear there. </li>

<li>Identifying countries when hovered over can mean the user gets more from interacting with the globe - if the country names appear straight away there is potentially a reduced sense of discovery
</li>

<li>Liked the simple background and found that there may be enough going on with the globe already - less distractions </li>
</ol>


<h3>Interviewer’s Observations: </h3>

<ol><li>Could control the globe intuitively without guidance</li>
  <li>Frequently turned the globe upside down on its head on purpose </li>
  <li>Took some time to notice the country names appear when hovered over - perhaps too subtle </li>
  </ol>


<h3>Areas for Improvement: </h3>
<ol><li>Make the country names more pronounced when the user hovers over a country </li>
  <li>Discuss/revisit alignment of the globe on the page</li>
  </ol>
