# Feedback on final website design
### Feedback on 12/05/2021

### How the session was conducted:
This session was conducted in person, but the audio was recorded with the user’s consent for later reference. The user had not participated in the previous sessions. They were briefed with ethics before the session. The project scope was explained to them after the user was left a while to interact with the website without guidance. They were shown the prototype and left to interact with it whilst the interviewer observed, answering any questions the user had. After interacting with it, we spoke about any feedback they had. The user was then explained the project brief and objectives, and we had a further discussion about any thoughts they had after being informed more.

### User 6:
**Interviewer’s Observations**

1. User did not particularly like the welcome page/book animation.
2. User navigated through the tutorial fine apart from the penultimate box which they never clicked through to (perhaps because the second to last tutorial box is in the bottom right corner so looks like it is the last one)
3. User needed some guidance with using the arrows to navigate through the timeline.
4. User was a little unsure at first about where to click to navigate from initial home page to the main site, but soon worked it out.


**User's feedback**

1. Initial graphics could be improved - especially the text in the book animation
2. Could put a line down the middle of the book to show the pages
3. A key to show the meaning of the colours would be good
4. It would be good to get the initial main tutorial box up again after you've clicked off of it
5. Main tutorial box should be simplified
6. Navigation is smooth
7. Could change the bar charts as you drag the slider to see changing literacy rates, rather than just updating when you let go. Would be better if it loaded as you scrolled.
8. Could have an option to show a summary of the years in a single box if you click on a country
9. Could have more information explaining interesting changes in data
10. Drawn on borders between countries would be good.
11. Labelling (of countries) seems a bit sporadic - could fill out more countries
12. Should reference where the data is being sourced from
13. If it is a year with no data, you could put in the last recorded literacy rate
14. Could put the last recorded literacy rate in the current year to show the change
15. Could put the flag of the country in the info box
16. Should standardize numbers to one decimal place
17. Bars should change back to original colour after clicking on them as the colour has meaning
18. For the target audience, should have colours that are nice to look at for a longer time
19. Could put facts related to the year, e.g. what famous books were released in a particular year, when this famous book was released, the literacy rate was this high
20. Needs to be something to grab the attention of the target audience
21. Could have the initial text backwards
22. Could skip out letters
23. Should put in some summaries of the data, like changes in world literacy rates, changes per country, reasons for increases

### Potential Areas to Improve:
1. Could adjust text/font on the book animation
2. Could put a line down the middle of the book to show the pages
3. Key to explain meaning of colours?
4. Option to bring back main tutorial after clicking off of it
5. Could explain what the literacy rate actually means (i.e. basic literacy, more advanced literacy...)
6. Should put in source of data & add some info summaries
