# Thematic Analysis – Feedback Session 5 Participant 6
In order to observe the usability of the website as well as to improve user experience, a series of feedback session and thematic analysis is needed. The feedback session was conducted in person, with audio recorded with the user’s consent for later reference. The user had not participated in the previous sessions and were briefed with ethics before the session. 
## Procedure
The participant was shown the prototype and left to interact with it without guidance whilst the interviewer observed the process, answering any questions the user had. After that, the project scope was explained and the user could give as much feedback as they desire. The participant was then given more details about the project brief and objectives, and discussed any thoughts after being further informed.
##  Results
The thematic analysis process applied to the transcripts elicited key concepts that were evident in the data. These themes are viewed as essential in determining the understandings of the participant, and the categories are defined as Autonomy of Navigation, Simplification is Good, and Grab User Attention separately. Although some aspects may overlap across the themes, this is regarded as positive as all aspects are relative to each other. 
###  Autonomy of Navigation
The participant liked being able to chose themselves how to navigate through the website, being able to return to sections they had previously visited. They found it frustrating when earlier featured could not be revisited, especially when the features involved instructions on how to use the website
> P – (talking about the first tutorial box on the main page) and does it go down to a key?
>
> I – what do you mean a key?
>
> P – as in, can I get that back (participant has clicked off of the main tutorial box and is referring to getting it back up again) 
>
> P – well, yeah, maybe an option to get that back, because it was describing what each thing did right? So there should be a key.
>
> ---
>
> P - And this staying purple after you’ve clicked on it… erm that’s good to see where you’ve been already, but like if I change it to something else (talking about another year) and then change it back to 1950 does it change back?
>
> ---
>
> P - See the show tutorial does something then (clicks through the tutorial again). Yeah. And then maybe an option to see that first page again (talking about the first tutorial box) would be nice.
> 

The participant liked that there were explanations for how to use the various features of the website, but they did not like the fact that you could not return to some aspects of the tutorial once you had clicked off of it.

> P – maybe, I don’t know how difficult this would be, but you know instead of dragging the slider to somewhere and seeing it load when you let go, it changes as you go through each year? So you can see where it changes. So like if I want to go somewhere where I see… I want to look through the UK one right? And I have to like go through each one to see if the UK one loads. So, if it just loaded as I scrolled that would be better. 
>

The user thought that more visual/active changes in the way the data was displayed would be more engaging. They liked being able to navigate through the years and seeing how information changed, but did not like the fact that missing data meant there was a lack of fluidity to the display of data.

### Simplification is Good

Overall, the user is able to figure out how to use the website and read literacy rates from it, but suggested we could benefit from summarising the data and simplification of tutorials/instructions on how to use the website. They missed some aspects of instruction, perhaps because of being overloaded with information.

> P – Um, this could probably do with simplifying? (talking about the first tutorial box on the main page) and does it go down to a key?
>
> ---
>
> P – oh yeah, that works as well. Have you got an option where, if I click on a country, it shows like the years in a single thing? I don’t think you have some of the countries written on here. Yeah I think you’d  probably benefit from having some like summarised stats of global literacy rates, or countries that were really good, now they’re really bad, or… yeah. And a key for these pegs (talking about the bars) would be useful. And then also, you know, if you suddenly get a country that increases – the literacy rate goes from very low to very high, you could have like oh something happened here
>
> I – mm, like an explanation?
>
> P – yeah I think if you had like, if you could click on individual countries and see how their literacy rate changes, it would be cool, I’m not sure if it’s quite hard to get the data.
>
> ---
>
> P - and then you could put um, the change from the last recorded literacy rate
>
> ---
>
> P - Yeah you should probably standardise your numbers. Having that is a bit much – probably one decimal place is fine. 
>
> ---
>
> P - definitely simplify the first thing that shows up, because you’re showing that to kids who have quite short attention spans, so you want to simplify things as much as possible. Maybe have some more pleasing graphics to the eye?
>
> ---
>
> P – yeah, maybe if you’re doing it for school you need to put in some summaries, summarise the data. Like changes in world literacy rates, changes per country, reasons for increases.
>

The user liked information being simply explained, especially the tutorials. They thought that having more clearly explained summaries of the data would be good, especially for our target audience. This included standardising the numbers to one decimal place and also presenting some interesting stories to accompany the data, for instance explanations for changes in rates between years. They again referred back to the clearer linking of data, making the visualisation of changing rates between years more fluid.

## Grab User Attention
Taking awareness of who our target audience is into account, the user emphasized the importance of having a suitable colour scheme and manipulating features of the website to really grab the users attention, and keep them engaged for a longer period of time.
> P – ok, well I think this graphic (talking about the intro book animation) isn’t a very good graphic
>
> I – and that’s the enter button, or just all of it?
>
> P – well, yeah, I’m not sure about the formatting of the graphics
>
> I – what do you think would be better?
>
> P – um, this kind of looks like just it’s been typed out on word and then just imported into PowerPoint
>
> I – and that’s the writing on the page of the book?
>
> P – yeah, and you could at least put a line down the middle of the book. Yeah, I just, maybe a bit of artistic graphic design coming into it.
>
> ---
>
> P - definitely simplify the first thing that shows up, because you’re showing that to kids who have quite short attention spans, so you want to simplify things as much as possible. 
>
> ---
>
> P - Yeah, I’d say the first graphic might need a bit of an upgrade but I think that’s difficult to do. I don’t know how you report that. I assume changing the font and the text should be fairly straightforward. Was it just, I didn’t actually see it, was it like backwards, or?
>
> I – just jumbled up
>
> P – just jumbled. You could do it backwards maybe. Or you could do that thing where you skip out letters, and most people can still read it if you take out the letters.
>


The user thought that the initial animation introducing the website could be improved in several aspects. They were a little unsure about how to navigate through it, hesitating before selecting the “enter” button. However, they soon worked it out, but remained unimpressed with the formatting of text and the graphics more generally.

>
> P - Maybe you could like, in this box (talking about the info box for the specific country) put the flag of the country
>
> ---
>
> P - Maybe have some more pleasing graphics to the eye?
>
> I – in what way?
>
> P – well if you have a scatter graph on there, you need it to stay simple, and have colours that are easy to look at for more than 30 seconds. And if it’s about literacy, you can put in some facts like, oh this is the year that Charles Dickers wrote X or this is the year… like when famous books were released then the literacy rate was this high. If your target audience was quite young, then there needs to be something that is going to grab their attention.
>

The user highlighted the idea of making the text boxes more engaging by including graphics (e.g. the country’s flag) within them. They also suggested the use of colourful graphs, to vary the modes of visualisation, but keep them simplified and appropriate for the target audience.
## Conclusion
The results highlighted some useful feedback from user, showing although a user could interact with the globe correctly without guidance, there are some aspects which need to be improved for better user experience. It can be estimated that given more suitable guidance and detailed information/introduction about the UI the potential users should feel easier to interact with globe and look through the data.
