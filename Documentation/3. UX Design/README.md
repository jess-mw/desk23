## a. Design Process and Early prototyping and ideation (including mood boards and paper prototyping)
*Hamza*

The ideation process took place collaboratively over several team meetings. The first session involved brainstorming and divergent thinking, aided by the mapping technique of putting serious topics and playful implementations next to each other to let ideas come out in unexpected ways (see Ideation > ideaMatrix document). The team then narrowed down ideas from this list, through allocating points to preferred topics. Once four core ideas had been identified, they were assessed for their strengths/limitations and feasibility. This was achieved through group writing on a shared document, which proved very effective in allowing team members to build on each other’s ideas and let creativity flow. At the conclusion of this process, the team had a clearer idea of the concept and was able to agree to move ahead with an interactive representation of global literacy rates. To elaborate on the idea, from this starting point, the team members went away individually to create paper (or digital) prototypes. We then convened to present these to each other and highlight the features that we imagined as part of the project. The design was then consolidated based on common elements, aided by additional group writing, into a singular paper prototype using Canva. We further were able to pull out interesting elements from each team member’s design through a "mash up" session dedicated to inventing unique combinations of ideas.

**Stakeholder Analysis**

In parallel, the team met to identify the stakeholders who would be involved in or otherwise impacted by the project. The stakeholder analysis was done in order to maximise the possible contribution of the project and anticipate the various interactions with other parties to be cognizant of the impacts, including ethical considerations. After initial brainstorming, mapping primary and secondary stakeholders and their possible interests and concerns, this chart was produced using Miro (see below) to demonstrate how stakeholders would be managed over the course of the project.

Stakeholders with high influence and high interest in the project include the target user (students/adolescents), the team itself (given a vested interest in the website’s success), and the University of Bristol as the locus of the project (including any potential reputational risks), and were deemed to require close engagement. In particular, given the educational nature of the website, the team agreed it would key to make sure that the website would be an inclusive and safe space for students of all abilities and backgrounds to navigate.

Next, the team considered others in the immediate circle of the student, including family and friends, and, critically, teachers who would need to be kept informed – in particular given their responsibility to safeguard their students and their role in potentially directing students to the website as an educational tool. Research participants, including users interacting with the surveys and making up the focus group, were also considered to fall in this category. The team considered it would be critical to seek out a diverse group of participants to ensure balanced responses; to make sure the survey would be designed not to be overly invasive; and, fundamentally, to protect the data collected. 

The awareness raising component of the website, from the general nature of the topic being treated, to any more specific links or resources provided on the page, could potentially implicate secondary stakeholders, including NGOs and charities. In directing traffic towards their causes, it would be important to scrutinise any organisations before listing them on the website to make sure users are directed to valid charities and to avoid inadvertently propagating scams. 

Other secondary stakeholders could include policymakers and international development partners looking for effective communication tools about literacy rates. 

It was noted that, though the website itself does not collect data from users, we would need to consider where we source our data from to ensure accuracy and consider attribution and any related licensing issues. In this respect, the data owners would need to be kept satisfied, and data properly referenced. Given that they could decide at any moment to restrict access to their data, the data owners were considered to have high power.

### Survey Findings

The next step was to develop a survey to cast the net wider to collect insights, validate fundamental assumptions underpinning the project, and inform the design. The survey was created using SurveyMonkey and shared with the team’s networks. The form included 10 multiple choice or free form questions geared towards understanding user preferences for data representation (based on the paper prototype) to augment the user experience, and gathering information on pre-existing knowledge about global literacy rates. The team analysed the 26 responses received and sought to take into account the feedback as the paper prototype was transformed into a Wireframe using Adobe XD. The survey results confirmed that an interactive globe would be a more interesting way to represent data, versus a tabular format or a static map. When selecting from a list where multiple options were permitted, 21 respondents (84 percent) said an interactive visualization would enhance the user experience, and 16 (64 percent) said it would be a fun and playful approach. Importantly, 18 (72 percent) said that it offers an improved understanding of what the data represents, a key assumption behind the educational aspect of the website.

Many respondents pointed out that a static 2D map would be easy to navigate and allow better comparison across regions of the globe since they could all be visible at once, however it would also limit user interaction and engagement, and could be dated and potentially lacking in novelty. On the other hand, the interactive 3D globe approach could risk being less user friendly, respondents found, but would be more exciting and potentially create a sense of exploration and discovery as the globe is traversed and rotated. The 3D globe was ultimately preferred by 71% of respondents.

Finally, only 20% of respondents correctly estimated the proportion of the world's population aged 15 years and above that is able to read and write today, and interestingly the majority of respondents reported being “somewhat confident” or “not so confident” about their ability to accurately estimate the proportion of their country's population that is literate, and how these rates compare to the global average, underscoring the necessity of such a tool.

### Focus Group Sessions

[Interview Methodology](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/tree/main/Documentation/3.%20UX%20Design/Feedback#interview-methodology)

A focus group was set up to ensure an understandable and user friendly product, comprised of the team’s friends and family. The focus group members took part in either in-person or virtual interviews to feed into the design and development process. They were given a chance to interact with the Wireframe, while key observations about their impressions and feelings interacting with the prototype were documented by a member of the team acting as interviewer (please refer to Feedback section). The users went into the session cold without much background information. The first interviews were carried out before Easter in the week of 22 March, and the feedback was incorporated into a revised wireframe in the first week of April, including inter alia the need for a tutorial to give some instructions for navigating the page and including arrows; contextualizing the use of scrambled, out-of-order text on the landing page; enhancing the backdrop and perhaps introducing fun and creative animation elements such as a starry sky or an alien spaceship passing by.

In a meeting to discuss the feedback from the focus group, the team identified another key question that had emerged, that of representing the data effectively on the globe. The first option discussed was a globe with the data shown as points of light, which shone brighter in areas with higher literacy rates. The second would be a colour-blocked approach along country borders where the data for countries across the globe taken together would be expressed as a gradient of one or more colours. In particular, given the goal of raising awareness of gaps in global literacy rates, we wanted to make sure that countries and regions with lower literacy rates were in focus, rather than areas that were already more advanced. However, there was some tension with the other key story in the data that we wanted to tell, that global literacy rates have been steadily growing over time, which the timeline feature brings out, and to which a lit up globe would be better suited. At this stage, we forked off of the initial wireframe to develop two separate iterations of the wireframe, to represent both the colour-blocked data representation and the lit up globe.

Focus group members interacted with the lit up globe option in a second round of feedback sessions which took place over 10-11 April. Given that the users had previously participated in the first feedback session, they already had an understanding of the brief and the problems we are aiming to tackle. Once again, we threw the users in the deep end, took down notes on the users’ actions and recorded their feedback on their experience interacting with the prototype. However, due to the limitations Adobe XD poses, at times we had to intervene and advise them on what button(s) to click to achieve the response they are seeking for.

The team discussed the feedback and potential areas for improvement in a 12 April stand-up. Key areas of feedback were that the book on the landing page may seem a bit out of place floating in space, so the team brainstormed options to better link up the landing page features with the globe in space that follows and considered whether the landing page couldn’t feature a different object other than a book, such as a monitor. Users also pointed out the importance of keeping track of the year as the slider is in use, rather than only showing the start and end dates of the dataset. The addition of the brief tutorial/instructions demo for interacting with the page was generally well received by users, and the suggestion came up to allow the user to test an action after each hint is offered, for example, after “Click the arrows to explore”, the user should be able to click either of the arrows and the globe should spin. Focus group members also sought more clarity on how countries would be identified, and how they could be quickly found, for example if the location of the country on the globe is unknown.
