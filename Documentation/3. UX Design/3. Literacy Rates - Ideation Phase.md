# Building on the Idea
### What have other sites done well? 
*	Displaying factual data in various forms e.g. tables, graphs, charts
*	Easy access to download the data 
*	Discussion and explanation of the method used to obtain this data 
*	Analysis of their data quality
*	Links to resources sometimes provided, fact sheets, NGO initiatives, etc
*	Easy access to individual country stats

### What have other sites done poorly? 
*	Analysis of the data not always well developed – lots there but not synthesised meaningfully
*	Making an interesting and interactive design with elements of playfulness

### How can we introduce a game element to the existing data?
*	Opportunity to interact with the data through interactive data visualisation – e.g. to access further info on country level data
*	Making the webapp accessible for people with visual impairments (e.g. Incorporation of sound) - could consider designing a website around requirements of visually impaired people (e.g. Responsive to keyboard input, improved image description, integrating with special software for navigating the web)
*	Potential ways of comparing life with ability to read and not?
*	Simulating not being able to read:
  *	Words/textual data scrambled/out of order
  *	Unfamiliar characters, Unicode or from other languages

### Additional Ideas: 
*	When entering the page, have an image aimed to simulate not being able to read, which then forms into a description of the problem and of what the web page is about
*	Then takes you to an interactive globe where the user can drag it around, click on different areas to see more detailed information
*	Inspiration: 
  *	 me too rising – visual display of literacy rates on countries e.g. brighter for areas with higher literacy rates? Colours? https://metoorising.withgoogle.com/ 
  *	Richard Mattka portfolio (look for inspiration in imagery and sound) https://richardmattka.com/ 
	* Visualizing countries by share of earth? https://www.visualcapitalist.com/countries-by-share-of-earths-surface/
* Look at for research in ways to use the earth to display data 
  *	https://zen.ly/ 
  *	https://paperplanes.world/
  *	http://news-lab-trends-experiment.appspot.com/
  *	https://music-globe.jtp.io/ 
  *	https://experiments.withgoogle.com/chrome/globe 
*	Making literacy one aspect of the visualization, once implemented, begin tackling other international issues, (food poverty, gender discrimination etc) in essence an interactive, international fact-file on a host of topics. 
*	Attached information could be: breakdown of data, links to charities that help, links to more information related to the area
  *	https://ourworldindata.org/literacy
  *	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_literacy_rate
  *	https://data.unicef.org/topic/education/literacy/
  *	https://literacytrust.org.uk/parents-and-families/adult-literacy/
  *	https://worldliteracyfoundation.org/ 
*	Use of sound? (e.g. voice of racism, me too rising, Richard Mattka Portfolio, Keep Portland Weird)
  *	https://voiceofracism.co.nz/
  *	https://www.midwam.com/en 
*	Could this respond to where the mouse is e.g. makes different sounds when the mouse is hovering over different areas
*	Louder sounds found countries with lower literacy rates – where the focus may need to be! 
*	Adding on to sound, we could make this a website friendly for those with visual impairments – hovering over different countries mentions the name of the country as well as a sound – depending on the volume the user may deduce the literacy rate levels of that country. 
*	Menu options in squiggles as well?
*	Different types of descriptions for different areas of literacy rates
