## a. Group working methods used (for instance did your team choose a particular style of agile? what communication channels did you use?)

### SCRUM or Kanban?

The core requirement set by ourselves was to create an application that solves the user’s needs. The user’s visions and expectations of our product must lie at the heart of it all. In order to do this, we needed to adopt a flexible and adaptable nature and maintain a consistent channel of dialogue with our users (as explained in the [UX Design Section]( https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/tree/main/Documentation/3.%20UX%20Design)).

As such, an Agile methodology seemed perfect for us to achieve this requirements. With the aim of consistently publishing our app and obtaining feedback on its operations, we debated between the use of Kanban and Scrum as the main method for organising our project. 

**Benefits of Kanban**

## b. Discussion of team roles (specialisation is ok!). A summary of individual contributions (note: this is for reference, your team will all receive the same grade!).

## c. Documentation of your sprints, including both high level overview, timeline, and selected highlights that were critical points in the project (remember to show the users stories implemented in each sprint). We expect a summary of meeting logs (including for instance apologies for absence etc)

### High level overview

* Details of sprint targets [sprint by sprint](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/main/Documentation/4.%20Sprints%20and%20Project%20Management/3.%20Sprints.md#sprints) and [week by week](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/main/Documentation/4.%20Sprints%20and%20Project%20Management/3.%20Sprints.md#week-by-week-1)

* Details of [meeting notes](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/tree/main/Documentation/4.%20Sprints%20and%20Project%20Management/Minutes)

The development of the project was split into [six main sprints](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/main/Documentation/4.%20Sprints%20and%20Project%20Management/3.%20Sprints.md#sprints), each one lasting two weeks. Each sprint was defined by a [user story](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/de9f01ae9e2cbb21b6e4b16f7435eaf4cd2fdb4d/Documentation/3.%20UX%20Design/9.%20User%20Stories.md) and we assigned tasks accordingly. We had shorter meeetings [throughout](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/tree/main/Documentation/4.%20Sprints%20and%20Project%20Management/Minutes) and [at the end of](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/main/Documentation/4.%20Sprints%20and%20Project%20Management/3.%20Sprints.md#week-by-week-1) each week to discuss general issues that had come up, and anything that needed team input. At the end of each sprint we conducted a longer meeting to reflect upon the targets, how progress on them had gone, whether we had reached our definition of done, and to set the next sprint's targets. Targets were set by deciding upon a user story for that week, and adding to the backlog of our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/iPzVt2TT/literacy-rates-around-the-world). Taking the user story and Trello board, we discussed as a team which tasks should be completed in the current sprint. Tasks were added to the Trello board in team meetings, mainly in the evaluative meeting at the end of each sprint, but also during the week when new tasks came up. These were also recorded in the [minutes](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/tree/main/Documentation/4.%20Sprints%20and%20Project%20Management/Minutes) from our meetings.

Below is a visual representation of how we used user stories in relation to each feature to allocate tasks, and how these were assigned across sprints.

Our Gantt chart displays how the tasks were spread out across time.
