## Workflow

## Git
Created one public repository 

* Main branch: only final code goes on here 
* Staging branch : finished features are pushed here to be tested before being deployed
* Dev branch: this is what individual team members branch off of and merge to 

Other branches: 

* Globe element – this is where the front end work for the globe design takes place 
* Database – this is where the database was developed 
* API_Jess – this is where Jess carried out work on linking the database with the API 
* Design - holds different prototypes, mood boards, etc. 
* Experimental - created by Hamza for front end experimental development 
* Threejs – where Hamza worked on his globe design 
* Jessconnect - branch on which Jess worked on connecting the front and back end
* Testing - branch where Emily tested features on
* Staging - branch on which finished features from dev were pushed to be tested before being deployed

Git work flow: each team member works on their own branch, pushing that branch to the repo at the end of each day. When that particular element is completed, the team communicates about it and selects one person to merge it with dev, resolving any conflicts .

Everyone using docker for full-stack development.
