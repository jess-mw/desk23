# Sprints

The development of our website was divided into six main sprints each lasting one week. Each sprint had relevant user stories, which helped us to define the added value of the product we were creating in that sprint and keep our user's needs in the forefront of our consciousness. At the end of each sprint, we met to review our progress on that sprint's tasks, evaluate how we had addressed the user story for that week, and assign the tasks and user story for the next sprint.
