The development of our website was divided into three main sprints each lasting two weeks. Each sprint had relevant user stories, which helped us to define the added value of the product we were creating in that sprint and keep our user's needs in the forefront of our consciousness. At the end of each sprint, we met to review our progress on that sprint's tasks, evaluate how we had addressed the user story for that week, and assign the tasks and user story for the next sprint.

# Sprint by Sprint
## Sprint 1 - Implement Globe: 5th - 18th April
### [Week 1](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/main/Documentation/4.%20Sprints%20and%20Project%20Management/3.%20Sprints.md#week-1-29th-march)

### User Stories
*As a user visiting the website, I want to be greeted with a home page so that I know what the website is about.*

*As a user visiting the website, I want to view a globe so that I can see a visualisation more interesting than text.*

### Overview & Definition of Done
This sprint involved creating at first a very basic template of our website, with a home page that worked and displayed a basic globe component created in Angular. In the front end, this sprint did not involve any interactivity; our definition of done was a simple globe being displayed on the home page with a short description of what the website is about. For the back end, this involved building the API and implementing the database. The definition of done for the database was having a connection that was set up in the Dockerfile, and had one basic collection (of data for literacy rates). The definition of done for the API was to have some basic routing in place, so that we had an understanding of how to implement this according to our needs later. Thus our overall definition of done for this sprint was a website that displayed a basic globe, with a working API and database containing one collection.

### Summary of meeting logs
Wenda was absent for the first meeting of this sprint, but otherwise all were present for all meetings. We began the sprint by ensuring that everyone was on track to complete the project workshops and looking at the feedback we got from our prototypes to inform our design choices. The other stand ups for that sprint mainly involved discussing difficulties with building the server and database, and we decided that Emily could help Wenda and Jess to distribute the work load a bit more. We also discussed different colours schemes and the feedback we were given by our users for each of them. For the front end, we had two versions of the globe being built with different tools - one with [D3](https://d3js.org/) and one with [three.js](https://threejs.org/). The progress, positives and negatives of each of these was also discussed in the meetings.

## Sprint 2 - Deploy Interactivity: 19th April - 2nd May

### [Week 3](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/main/Documentation/4.%20Sprints%20and%20Project%20Management/3.%20Sprints.md#week-3-12th-april)
### [Week 4](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/main/Documentation/4.%20Sprints%20and%20Project%20Management/3.%20Sprints.md#week-4-19th-april)

### User Stories
*As a student visiting the website, I want to be able to interact with the elements in a playful way to engage in a more interesting way with the data/learning aspects.*

*As a student visiting the website, I want to be able to spin the globe so that I can discover and easily compare literacy rates around the world.* 

*As a student visiting the website, I want to be able to click on countries so that I can get more information on the literacy rates of a specific country.* 

### Overview & Definition of Done
This sprint involved introducing elements of interactivity to our website. For the front end, this meant adding in functionality to spin the globe and display literacy rates data linked to each country. After running feedback sessions with end users, we took the evaluated feedback and used it to adjust our design and improve the look and feel of the website. For the back end, this meant adding in two new collections to the database: one that contained data in relation to country coordinates, so that they could be plotted onto the globe. Another collection was created that removed any noise from the data and linked the literacy rates with country coordinates. The API was then worked on to link these collections in the database with the front end. Thus the definition of done for this sprint was to have a globe that the user could spin, and click on different countries to view data about their literacy rates. This data came from our database, through the API.

### Summary of meeting logs
All members were present for all of these meetings. Our first meeting discussed what our next targets and definition of done would be. This involved talking about how to link up the server and front end in a better way to display the data, and creating better ways to access the database in the server. We also discussed how to design navigation through the website, and if we should create different pages for different purposes. We decided to create a new collection for the database that incorporated all the data we needed. Various methods of doing this were discussed, but in the end we decided to do this manually so that the data could be properly vetted, which we had not yet done in detail. We had a couple of feedback meetings with members of the teaching team to clarify design choices and how to implement HCI evaluation.

## Sprint 3 - Introduce Timeline & Book: 3rd - 14th May

### [Week 5](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/main/Documentation/4.%20Sprints%20and%20Project%20Management/3.%20Sprints.md#week-5-4th-may)
### [Week 6](https://github.com/jess-mw/desk23/blob/main/Documentation/4.%20Sprints%20and%20Project%20Management/3.%20Sprints.md#week-6-10th-may)

### User Stories
*As a student visiting the website, I want to be able to change the date dynamically so that I can understand how literacy rates have changed over time.*

*As a student visiting the website, I want to have access to resources curated for my age group so that I can take my understanding further and continue learning.*

*As a teacher, I want to be able to interact with global literacy rates data so I can identify trends together with my students.*

*As a student visiting the home page, I want the first information I see to be presented in a fun and easy to read manner so that I am drawn into the website.*

*As a student visiting the home page, I want to be able to navigate from the book into the main website that contains the globe element.*

*As a teacher showing the website to my children, I want the book to explain in a simple way what literacy rates are and why it is an issue we need to learn about.*

### Overview & Definition of Done
For this sprint, we introduced two new features to our website: the book that greets the user as they enter the website, and the timeline that the user can interact with in the main website to engage with how the data has changed over time. In the front end of the website, this meant building two new components: the book component and timeline component. During the sprint we ran more feedback sessions with end users, to evaluate the design of the website and improve the features. This ensured that we were really addressing our user stories about how the information was being presented and whether we were appealing to our target audience. In the back end, this meant ensuring that routing was all in place. The database did not need any new collections at this stage, however we created a seeding script to be run the first time the site is set up on a machine to ensure the database was properly populated. The definition of done for this sprint was thus a website that began with a book giving an overview of the project, and led to a globe that the user could spin and click on different countries to read data about the literacy rates. They could also interact with a timeline, that adjusted the data in accordance with what year the user was currently on. for the back end, the definition of done was having a fully working API that linked the front and back end, and a database that could be easily set up when the website was implemented for the first time.
