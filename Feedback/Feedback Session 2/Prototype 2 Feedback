Prototype – See Draft 2 in Adobe XD
Feedback on 10/04/2021

How the session was conducted:
The two users (named below) previously participated in the first feedback session. As such, they understand the brief and the problems we are aiming to tackle. For the second feedback session, we have taken a similar approach to throwing the users in the deep end once again. However, due to the limitations Adobe XD poses, at times we had to intervene and advise them on what button(s) to click to achieve the response they are seeking for. 
We took down qualitative notes on the users’ actions. After which, we asked them for feedback on their experience of the website. The users were then asked to complete a simple questionnaire to help provide us with some quantitative data regarding the website as well.
Please note that the below feedback has been processed – as such, duplicated feedback has been removed. 
This focus group consists of two users.
In the previous feedback session, the notes were separately taken. This time, we have consolidated the results into one as there were a lot of similarities between both.

User’s Feedback: 
-	Consider allowing the user to click to change from pages e.g. someone could miss the opening sentence ‘What if you were unable to read?’.
-	Introductory line does provide a lot more information – nice approach!
-	Introductory line does provide a lot more information – nice approach!
-	Maybe indicate the literacy rates disparities at the start if that is your goal.
-	Instructions/hints are clear and used well.
o	Might be more effective if after each hint, the user is able to test it out. For example, when it says “Click the arrows to explore”, the user should be able to click the either of the arrows and the globe should spin. Likewise with other hints. 
-	Dragging the globe is cool – like before – but will it be able to move in all directions or just left and right? (Was explained to be a limitation of Adobe XD and that the globe hopefully will be able to move in all directions).
-	Really like the overall design – colours are much more vibrant and the arrows make it seem a lot more fun (which they understand to be a part of the brief).
-	Would be better if the slider showed which year it currently was on rather than just the first and final year. 
-	What do all the lights represent on the globe? How do I know which country is which e.g. if I am unsure of where a certain country is?

Interviewer’s Observations: 
-	Since the users had already tested the website in the previous feedback session, they had a good understanding of what to expect / how to operate the interface. 
-	One of them tried moving the moon (potential area to improve).
-	Users preferred dragging the globe rather than using the arrows. 
-	User expected the globe to zoom into a country upon being cliced. 

Potential Areas to improve:
-	The moon or the sun could be our slider! If we can figure out a way to create a curved slider over the top of the globe that is...
-	Perhaps the arrows should only exist as hints rather than usable items?
