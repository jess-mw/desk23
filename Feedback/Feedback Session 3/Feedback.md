First Prototype of Website (non paper prototype) 

Focus Group: 2 Candidates  

 

<h3>User feedback:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The green orbs look unappealing and weird / distracting. 
      <ol><li>Despite this, it does make clicking on the countries easier (as the entire country is not clickable). </li> </ol>
  </li>

<li>Website is slightly choppy. </li>

<li>Show and hide tutorial buttons seem to be misplaced at the top of the website, bottom corners would be more suitable.  </li>

<li>Tutorials should be more informative and with less text – use images (didn’t you have arrows in your previous prototypes? They were nice!).  </li>

<li>The skybox makes for a much more interesting background – enjoy the fact that it moves when you spin the globe.  </li>

<li>All the colour combinations are off – no apparent colour scheme.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Interviewer’s Observations: </h3>

<ol>
  <li>First thing that users tested was the globe – ignoring the tutorial </li>

<li>It is possible that they have come across similar products before, so already had an understanding of how the globe should move. </li>

<li>Given that, it is good to note that the globe responded well to their expectations.  </li>

<li>If their mouse click was released on a certain country, it would be selected. This was not their intention, rather a bug in the code. Users did not complain though. </li>

<li>User tested the slider and it worked seamlessly.  </li>
</ol>
