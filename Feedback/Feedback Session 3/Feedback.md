<h1> First Prototype of Website (non paper prototype)</h1>

<h2> Feedback Gathered on: 28/04/2021</h2>

Focus Group: 2 Candidates  
 

<h3>User feedback:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The green orbs look unappealing and weird / distracting. 
      <ol><li>Despite this, it does make clicking on the countries easier (as the entire country is not clickable). </li> </ol>
  </li>

<li>Website is slightly choppy. </li>

<li>Show and hide tutorial buttons seem to be misplaced at the top of the website, bottom corners would be more suitable.  </li>

<li>Tutorials should be more informative and with less text – use images (didn’t you have arrows in your previous prototypes? They were nice!).  </li>

<li>The skybox makes for a much more interesting background – enjoy the fact that it moves when you spin the globe.  </li>

<li>All the colour combinations are off – no apparent colour scheme.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Interviewer’s Observations: </h3>

<ol>
  <li>First thing that users tested was the globe – ignoring the tutorial </li>

<li>It is possible that they have come across similar products before, so already had an understanding of how the globe should move. </li>

<li>Given that, it is good to note that the globe responded well to their expectations.  </li>

<li>If their mouse click was released on a certain country, it would be selected. This was not their intention, rather a bug in the code. Users did not complain though. </li>

<li>User tested the slider and it worked seamlessly.  </li>
</ol>

The feedback session took place remotely using Zoom. 

<h3>User feedback:</h3>

<ol>

<li>The globe is eyecatching and the land in particular is very realistic, looks a bit 3D. </li>

<li>Slight website lag detected - could be due to the Zoom screensharing. </li>

<li>Doesn't feel like our Earth - might help to add the moon in within the 360 view.  </li>

<li>Big changes in the sky in the background (from darker to brighter areas) as it moves may draw attention away from the Earth </li>

<li>Liked that the globe doesn't show borders between countries
  <ol><li>Makes countries seem closer by, and borders seem to matter less, may help to highlight disparities in literacy rates, particularly between neighbours </li> 
    <li>Makes literacy rates a less political, more global issue  </li> </ol>
</li>

<li>Noted that the blue of the ocean is not very realistic, while the background and land are photorealistic- found this difficult to reconcile and a little jarring </li>
</ol>


<h3>Interviewer’s Observations: </h3>

<ol><li>Could control the globe intuitively without guidance</li>
  <li>Seemed to enjoy clicking on the globe and kept manipulating it throughout the interview</li>
  </ol>
