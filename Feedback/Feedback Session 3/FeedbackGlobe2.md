<h1> First Prototype of Website (non paper prototype) - Globe 2 produced using D3</h1>


<h2> Feedback Gathered on: 29/04/2021</h2>

Focus Group: 1 Candidate
 
The feedback session took place remotely using Zoom, at the same time as the interview for the three.js website prototype (Globe 1).

<h3>User feedback:</h3>

<ol>

<li>Found the globe sleek and minimal, with a certain level of abstraction to it. </li>

<li>Liked the red/black colour palette. </li>

<li>Thought the globe was appearing off-centre, and wondering if something was missing to the left of the globe, eg. if any information would appear there. </li>

<li>Big changes in the sky in the background (from darker to brighter areas) as it moves may draw attention away from the Earth </li>

<li>Identifying countries when hovered over can mean the user gets more from interacting with the globe - if they appear straight away there is potentially a reduced sense of discovery
</li>

<li>Liked the simple background and found that there may be enough going on with the globe already - less distractions </li>
</ol>


<h3>Interviewerâ€™s Observations: </h3>

<ol><li>Could control the globe intuitively without guidance</li>
  <li>Frequently turned the globe upside down on its head </li>
  <li>Took some time to notice the country names appear when hovered over - perhaps too subtle </li>
  </ol>
